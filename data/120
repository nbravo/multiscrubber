PULMONARY EMBOLUS
Signed
DIS
Admission Date :
04/06/1998
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
04/12/1998
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
PULMONARY EMBOLUS HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient remained in-house on IV heparin awaiting discharge to rehabilitation at Ocfasciences Valley Hospital Medical Center at the Wesrajoke Healthcare .
The patient &apos;s course remained uncomplicated .
Hematology :
The patient &apos;s hematocrit has slowly drifted down from his admission hematocrit of 38 down to 33.6 .
Given that the patient had not had a bowel movement during his entire hospital course , we were unable to document whether he was having gastrointestinal loss but it is unlikely that it is a large bleed , given there is no overt evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient will ultimately need a colonoscopy as an outpatient , given his age and concern for occult malignancy as a cause of his likely gastrointestinal blood loss .
That can be arranged by his primary care physician back in Plain Pa .
Pulmonary embolus :
The patient will need to remain on Coumadin for six months .
His Coumadin dose will need to be titrated while at Coness- Tansdener Medical Center .
For the time being , his Tamoxifen is being held given its thrombogenic potential and that will have to be readdressed by his primary care physician upon his return to Rie , North Dakota .
It may not be unreasonable to restart the tamoxifen even whileon the coumadin .
Orthopedics :
The patient is status post multiple left upper extremity fractures .
The patient was followed by orthopedics during his hospital stay .
He will not need to follow-up at Pointexasp Region General Hospital during his stay at the rehabilitation and can follow-up once he returns back to Grovecu And in three to four weeks .
His fractures are stable by x-ray .
Physical therapy :
The patient has been cleared for passive range of motion exercises at the left elbow approximately two to three weeks after his initial fractures which will be on Monday , 04/15/98 .
The patient will need to have aggressive physical therapy for reconditioning given his marked deconditioning from his past two hospitalizations .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin 1,250 units per hour IV until INR greater than 2 , Lactulose 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , vitamin E 400 units p.o. q.d. , Trazedone 50 mg p.o. qhs , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. qhs , multivitamin with iron 1 tablet p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets q4h p.r.n. pain .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
The patient is discharged to Coness- Tansdener Medical Center where he will need aggressive physical therapy given his deconditioning status post his fall and recent hospitalization .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will need follow-up with his primary care physician back in Ma Tony , Rhode Island in three weeks , as well as orthopedic follow-up in Wawa Lero .
