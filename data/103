DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Dehydration , electrolyte imbalance .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 85-year-old male who has had longstanding diarrhea over the years and comes in because of severe dehydration , referred from the Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital .
He had had previous studies including a computed axial tomography scan which showed no pathology and they were at a loss to explain his diarrhea and dehydration .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Accordingly , the patient underwent numerous studies here , all of which were negative including endoscopic assessment of his upper gastrointestinal tract and colonoscopy , both of which were normal .
The patient seemed to settle down while in the hospital and in fact started to have solid bowel movements and so on a controlled diet , which was purposely free of milk and milk products , the patient was discharged to be followed by his doctor , Dr. Both at the Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital but suffice it to say that no pathology was found in this hospital .
He had widespread abdominal distention and for a while looked like he might have had ischemic problems with his sigmoid colon resulting in a functional large bowel obstruction but this cleared while he was in the hospital and he expelled large amounts of gas and decompressed his distention and his diarrhea stopped and he seemed to be much , much better .
Whether this was related to medication , viral gastroenteritis or ischemic bowel problems is unclear , but he got better and went home .
