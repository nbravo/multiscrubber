Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
04/12/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PNEUMONIA WITH QUESTION OF ASPIRATION .
PROBLEMS :
1) DEMENTIA DUE TO PICK &apos;S DISEASE .
2) HISTORY OF VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY .
3) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
4) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 71 year-old male with Pick &apos;s disease causing dementia who presented one day after having eaten one-half bar of Ivory soap .
The following day on the day of admission , he was noted to have a gurgling sound in his throat by his daughter .
His daughter brought him to [ORG Nor Memorial Hospital  ] where he was noted to have a fever of 102 degrees .
A chest x-ray at that time showed a right middle lobe infiltrate .
He was treated with Ceftriaxone and transferred to [ORG Ver Medical Center  ] .
At that time , his temperature was 100.2 degrees .
He had an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air .
He was noted to have a potassium of 2.6 .
Chest x-ray was re-read and confirmed as a right middle lobe pneumonia .
He received 600 mg of intravenous Clindamycin to cover for anaerobes in case there was aspiration and was admitted for treatment of his pneumonia .
His mental status was noted to be at baseline by the family .
He is essentially nonverbal answering &quot; no &quot; or &quot; I don&apos;t know &quot; to most questions .
History was obtained from the medical record and the family .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As mentioned in the problem list .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Temperature 100.6 degrees , heart rate 102 , blood pressure 107/54 , oxygen saturation 92% on room air .
In general , he was an elderly white male sleeping flat in no acute distress , awakened easily , but was not oriented at all .
HEENT examination was benign .
Neck had no jugular venous distension and 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits .
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs appreciated .
Lungs had rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally , scattered throughout , no egophony or clear area of consolidation was noted .
The abdomen was benign .
The extremities were without edema and had 2+ distal pulses .
Neurological examination was alert , but not oriented .
He followed some simple commands .
He moves all extremities well .
Gait was not tested .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission included a sodium of 140 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 29 , BUN 22 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 98 .
White blood cell count was 1.73 , hematocrit 37.0 , platelet count 215 .
Chest x-ray revealed a right middle lobe opacity , no effusion , no edema .
EKG was normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and right bundle branch block with prior inferior myocardial infarction .
There is no prior EKG available for comparison .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and given a course of p.o. antibiotics including Levofloxacin and Flagyl with plans for a fourteen day course .
He initially received oxygen , two liters via nasal cannula , but had an oxygen saturation that remained at 92% on room air , so oxygen was discontinued .
His potassium was repleted from 2.6 up to 3.3 the day after admission and then up to 4.2 two days after admission .
The source for his hypokalemia was unknown .
He initially had watery diarrhea , thought secondary to soap ingestion which resolved two days after admission .
He was gently hydrated with 1/2 normal saline for two liters to keep up with his gastrointestinal losses .
He was continued on Risperdal which he takes for dementia .
He did have fevers the day after admission , but his fever curve gradually came down .
Because of the question of aspiration , a Speech and Swallow evaluation was obtained .
Before this evaluation , discussion was undertaken with the family who decided that even if the patient were aspirating that they would not want a feeding jejunal tube for feeding placed .
Speech evaluation felt that he may be aspirating occasionally when he coughs , however they did not recommend dietary modifications , but only that he be given soft , easily chewed items .
They also suggested that he be observed at meals to make sure that he paces himself to avoid aspirating .
They recommended follow-up evaluation if he develops further pneumonias or if he has increased coughing .
This can be arranged through his primary care physician or through the rehabilitation hospital if he is still an inpatient at rehabilitation .
The family also decided to make the patient DNR / DNI after he was admitted .
He will be transferred to rehabilitation to finish his course of antibiotics and to work on ambulation .
He will then return home with [ORG HMC  ] services to live with his daughter-in-law and son .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day times six days for a total of fourteen days .

Discharge Date :
12/08/1997
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
PERFORATED APPENDICITIS AND APPENDICEAL ABSCESS .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS WAS NONE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old white female who presented to the Emergency Department at the [ORG Ver Medical Center  ] with a chief complaint of diffuse abdominal pain which was periumbilical in origin .
Patient had experienced periumbilical pain which was nonradiating , mild , and stable for approximately three days .
In addition , she had had three days of nausea and vomiting .
She complained of no dysuria and no vaginal or urinary discharge .
Her last meal was on the day of admission .
Her last bowel movement was two days prior to admission and her last menstrual period was on November 6 , 1997 .
Patient did note some slight anorexia .
PAST MEDICAL / SURGICAL HISTORY :
Unremarkable .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
She took no medications .
ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She had a temperature of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit , heart rate 115 , and blood pressure 139/89 .
HEENT :
Oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , and pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .
CHEST :
Lungs were clear to auscultation .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
ABDOMEN :
Positive bowel sounds , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , no costovertebral angle tenderness , no hernia , and no rebound or guarding .
There was mild right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant tenderness and no masses palpable .
RECTAL :
Nontender and hemoccult negative .
PELVIC :
Examination showed no masses and mild cervical motion tenderness .
EXTREMITIES :
No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .
NEUROLOGICAL :
No focal deficits .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Studies revealed that chemistries were within normal limits , white blood cell count was 20.8000 , hematocrit was 38 , and platelets were 272,000 .
KUB was performed in the Emergency Room which showed dilated loops of small bowel with no air fluid levels .
In addition , an ultrasound was performed of the right lower quadrant which showed no evident appendix .
The pelvis and pelvic structures were normal and there was a normal gallbladder and kidneys seen on the right .
Chest x-ray was unremarkable , urinalysis was negative , and beta HCG was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a principle diagnosis of likely perforated appendicitis .
She was admitted and put on intravenous antibiotics with plan of obtaining an abdominopelvic CT scan .
On the day of admission , an abdominopelvic CAT scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of fluid filled bowel and colon in the right lower quadrant .
The colon was decompressed distally and there was no contrast seen in the lower intestine .
This was thought to represent at least a partial small bowel obstruction or possibly an ileus .
There were some bubbles of free air which were thought to be extraluminal .
The primary diagnosis at that time was complicated or perforated appendicitis with partial small bowel obstruction .
A delayed CT scan was planned in order to follow contrast through the lower intestine and on this delayed CT scan , contrast was seen passing distally through the lower intestine .
At this time , on hospital day one with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis and right lower quadrant phlegmon , it was felt that this course of action would be to either proceed with surgery or attempt to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and possibly wait for six weeks for elective appendectomy .
The patient was started on triple antibiotics of ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl , kept NPO , and serial examinations were obtained .
Over the first three hospital days , her white blood cell count fell to under 10,000 .
Sips of clear liquids were started and were tolerated without complication .
Patient &apos;s physical examination remained relatively unremarkable , however , she began to develop slight abdominal distention .
After the patient was tolerating clear sips , she was given one liter of Golytely with the intention of clearing out her bowel in case surgery was needed .
Repeat CAT scan was obtained on hospital day five .
This CAT scan was relatively unchanged showing matted loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant .
The appendix was not well visualized .
The repeat CT scan also showed contained fluid collections in the pelvis and these were not felt to be communicating .
These were also not felt to be collections which could be drained by interventional radiology .
Given the progression of the patient &apos;s CAT scan and the relative nonprogression of her clinical course , the decision was made after discussion with the patient to proceed with exploratory laparotomy and likely ileocecectomy with secondary wound closure .
Patient &apos;s bowel was further prepared with p.o. erythromycin and neomycin base in one additional liter of Golytely .
She experienced extreme nausea and vomiting with the erythromycin and neomycin .
On December 3 , 1997 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and under general anesthesia , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy , drainage of intraabdominal abscesses , and appendectomy by Dr. [PER Zamorryn He  ] .
No ileocecectomy was performed .
Cultures were taken of the peritoneal fluid .
These peritoneal fluid cultures subsequently grew E. coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
The patient &apos;s perioperative antibiotics ( ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl ) were continued .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Recovery Room then subsequently to the floor .
Pain service consultation was obtained for perioperative pain control and a patient controlled analgesia was begun .
Patient &apos;s nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day one and by postoperative day two , the patient was out of bed and ambulating .
On postoperative day three , the patient was started on oral sips and by postoperative day four , the patient was tolerating over a liter a day of clear liquids and had had one bowel movement .
Her abdominal pain was dramatically decreased at this time .
She had no abdominal distention and no erythema around the wound .
Two Jackson-Pratts were placed intraoperatively .
At the time of this dictation on postoperative day four , the Jackson-Pratts had put out under 5 cc of discharge per day .
The patient is scheduled to be discharged tomorrow on December 8 , 1997 .
Her Jackson-Pratt drains will be discontinued in the morning and the patient will be discharged on ofloxacin and Flagyl p.o. for a total antibiotic course of fourteen days which includes an additional nine days of antibiotics with the patient &apos;s operative date being considered day one of antibiotics .
DISPOSITION :
Disposition is home without services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. pain .

2) ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .
He was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .
On the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .
The family reported one episode of vomiting at home .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters .
General :
The patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing .
Neck was supple with full range of motion .
No bruits were heard .
Chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry .
Heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present .
Extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech .
Pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally .
There was no pupillary defect .
Dolls eye was negative .
There was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes .
Corneals were present bilaterally .
Gag was present weakly .
Face was symmetrical .
Tongue was midline .
The patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .
There was only minimal movement on the left side .
On sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .
The left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 .
AST was 20 , ALT 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 .
Thyroid function tests were normal .
Troponin I was 0.05 .
Total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .
PT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes .
A chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .
The head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
Neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
Eyes were closed .
He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
Withdrawal to pain was still present .
Both plantars were upgoing .
A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia .
The patient &apos;s temperature was 102 degrees .
A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .
This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
The left vertebral artery was not visualized .
There was a dominant right vertebral artery .
There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .
The patient &apos;s family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .
The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 .

It was decided to make the patient comfortable during this meeting .
This means that he is not to receive chemotherapy of any type including palliative chemotherapy .
Also Gastroenterology consultation did not recommend stent placement as there was no focal stenosis that could be intervened upon .
During this meeting , he was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate and he is to be discharged to the [ORG Hend Geadcoastcar Hospital  ] where the emphasis should be entirely on this patient &apos;s comfort ; that is antiemetics as he needs , pain control as needed and nutrition for his comfort .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. [PER Counts  ] has known metastatic breast cancer and has been on treatment with Fareston and Aredia .
On the day she was seen for her regular office evaluation and treatment , she was noted to be very slightly confused , nauseated , vomiting , and dehydrated .
Laboratory studies were obtained which showed that she was hypercalcemic and mildly azotemic .
Her calcium was 16.6 with an albumin of 2.5 and her creatinine was 2.6 .
She was admitted to the hospital and given intravenous Saline and then Lasix .
She was also treated with Calcitonin .
During this hospitalization with hydration and diuresis , her calcium fell to normal levels and her renal function corrected to normal .
It was felt that the cause of her hypercalcemia is related to progression of metastatic breast cancer and possibly as a flare to Fareston .
The Fareston was discontinued , Lupron 7.5 mg monthly was initiated and Arimidex 1 mg PO q.d. was initiated .
She was able to tolerate these medicines quite well .
In addition , we started her on Taxol 80 mg per meter square with the first dose administered on 01/30/2000 and to be continued as an outpatient .
She complained of some pain in her left lower extremity .
Deep venous thrombosis was shown by color flow Doppler and she was started on Fragmin and Coumadin during this hospitalization .
Fragmin will be continued as an outpatient until the Coumadin dose is established and then this can be discontinued .
The patient was discharged home with nursing care and will be followed by Dr. [PER Fyfesaul  ] with her first appointment on 02/06/2000 .
We will continue her on treatment with Taxol .
Lupron and Arimidex were continued .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73 year old female who was transferred for cardiac catheterization after ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction and a urinary tract infection .
The patient was admitted on 3-16-93 to [ORG Diy Hospital  ] for an E. coli urinary tract infection .
The patient was readmitted on 3-20-93 because of fever , chills and a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation arrest , successfully cardioverted back to rapid atrial fibrillation and finally to sinus rhythm , where an electrocardiogram then showed ST elevation in inferior leads .
Peak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB &apos;s .
She required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin .
She had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , blood pressure is 130/80 , pulse 74 and regular , respirations 14 .
Her chest demonstrated bibasilar crackles .
Cardiovascular exam :
the jugular venous pressure was seven centimeters , carotid upstroke normal .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 was normally split .
There was an S4 , no S3 , grade II/VI apical murmur in systole , no rubs .
The abdomen was benign , unremarkable .
Extremities :
no calf tenderness or peripheral edema .
Peripheral pulses were 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 3-27-93 , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications .

The left main coronary artery was clear .
The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view .
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis .
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery .
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation .
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation .
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone .
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 .
The patient had no further angina .
On 4-2-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study .
This showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris .
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall .
This was consistent with scar .
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone .
In view of these findings , it was elected to discharge her on her present medical program .
The patient is to return to the follow up care of Dr. [PER Ko Kollciem  ] at the [ORG Diy Hospital  ] .

The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .
The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in [LOC Otte A , New Jersey  ] and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .
Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery .
Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .
On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. [PER Medicine  ] and Dr. [PER Room  ] .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .
She was begun on a heparin drip .
On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to [ORG Rockdempbanri Hospital  ] on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pain .
A cardiac catheterization in 07/93 showed diffuse mid left anterior descending of 90% , 30% D1 and 70% circumflex .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room and tolerated the procedure well .
His intensive care unit stay was notable for intensive care unit psychosis which was treated with Haldol and Ativan .
He slowly resolved and became alert and oriented times three .
He was ambulating well .
He had a psychiatry consult who agreed with the management .
His blood pressure control was somewhat difficult in the intensive care unit .
He received beta blockers both po and IV .
This caused him to become bradycardic down to the rate of 40 &apos;s .
It was felt that he was not a beta blocker candidate postoperatively .
Therefore , his pressure control will be done with hydralazine and could later be controlled with another agent as his cardiologist sees fit .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS :
On discharge included his pre-admission medications as well as one aspirin per day and Floricet , 0.1 mg po q day ; hydrazaline , 10 mg po q.i.d.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 73 year old white female with a history of pancreatic cancer treated with 5-FU and a vague history of chest pain , admitted with EKG changes of unclear duration , consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction .
In March of 1989 , she presented with painless jaundice , and a workup included pancreatic cancer .
She underwent a Whipple procedure and a cholecystectomy .
Four months prior to admission , she had occasional band like chest pain across her entire chest .
In January of 1989 , she was begun on 5-FU for five days of treatment followed by three weeks of no treatment .
Since then , she has had occasional lower sternal chest pain when lying on her side , reproducible by palpation .
Two weeks prior to admission , she had a presyncopal episode but did not lose consciousness .
There were no other symptoms .
One day prior to admission , she was seen at the [ORG Dagreat Health  ] for 5-FU , her third cycle .
She complained of chest pain and back pain , and an EKG was obtained which showed new Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , and T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , consistent with an anterior septal myocardial infarction .
She was reviewed by the cardiologists and was admitted for further evaluation of her myocardial infarction .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Include smoking and increased cholesterol .
There is no diabetes , hypertension , or family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes (1) pancreatic cancer , status post a Whipple procedure , on 5-FU .
(2) Status post a cholecystectomy , appendectomy , and hysterectomy .
(3) Fibrocystic breast disease .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Include 5-FU and Percocet for pain , Zantac , and Simethicone .
She has no known drug allergies .
She smoked up until ten years ago .
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is an elderly white female in no apparent distress with a temperature of 97.6 , blood pressure 122/70 , heart rate of 72 , and a respiratory rate of 20 .
Her physical examination is notable for an essentially entirely normal physical examination .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , includes a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 312 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
The CK was 89 .
The urinalysis showed 5-10 white blood cells .
There were two red blood cells .
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 , axis -30 degrees , Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , new in comparison to June of 1985 .
The chest x-ray showed a slightly increased cardiac size .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the [ORG Dagreat Health  ] Service where she ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CK &apos;s and LDH &apos;s .
However , her EKG &apos;s did progress to T-wave inversions in V1-V6 , and it was felt that the patient most likely had at some point had a myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram was done which showed apical septal akinesis , but with well preserved systolic function .
The patient was started on Ecotrin and a beta blocker as well as Isordil and Diltiazem for the possibility of 5-FU induced vasal spasm .
Her medicines could not be increased beyond low doses secondary to a low systolic blood pressure .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified Bruce protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
She did not have any chest pain or EKG changes , however , hermaximal heart rate was 71 , and her blood pressure was 110/60 .
It was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at home , and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .
PROBLEM # 2 :
PANCREATIC CANCER .
The patient will be continued on her 5-FU as an outpatient , to be followed by Dr. [PER Liermfelsbelb  ] .
Lumbosacral spines done during the admission did not show any change from x-rays done previously .
PROBLEM # 3 :
HISTORY OF DIZZINESS .
The patient complained of some dizziness and had a presyncopal episode prior to admission , however , the patient felt that her dizziness was unchanged from the dizziness that she had for several years .
She will be followed up by Dr. [PER Liermfelsbelb  ] .
PROBLEM # 4 :
ANEMIA .
The patient had an anemia on admission .
She had normal iron and TIBC .
Reticulocyte count is pending at the time of this dictation .
I suspect that this is anemia of chronic disease , but could not rule out gastrointestinal blood loss , although she remained guaiac negative .
PROBLEM # 5 :
PYURIA .
The patient 8-10 white blood cells in the urine on admission , and the urine culture was no growth so far at the time of discharge .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being discharged in stable condition , and is to be followed up with Dr. [PER Liermfelsbelb  ] .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Include Pepcid 20 mg b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and Ecotrin one tablet p.o. q.d.
She should arrange to be followed up by Dr. [PER Liermfelsbelb  ] .
Her diet is a low cholesterol diet .

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
DIABETES ADULT ONSET .
HISTORY OF CARDIOVASUCLAR ACCIDENT .
GUAIAC POSITIVE .
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old man , who was transferred from [ORG Tlowepeh Hospital  ] after an anterolateral MI , with post MI stuttering chest pain .
His coronary risks factors are prior MI , smoking until he quit more than forty years ago , and adult onset diabetes with question of increased cholesterol .
He has no history of hypertension or family history .
In 1960 , the patient had an MI complicated by ventricular ectopic arrhythmia .
At that time he was placed on Quinidine for his arrhythmia , questioned atrial fibrillation at that time .
Since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left-sided chest pain that is always relived by a brief rest .
He also notes an induration caudication in his left calf .
On 12/15/90 , he had a parietal headache at 8:00 a.m. that was followed promptly by left-sided chest pain without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .
He went to the [ORG Tlowepeh Hospital  ] Emergency Room , where his blood pressure was 120/80 , heart rate was 94 , respiratory rate was 32 , and he had a blood gas which was pO2 73 , pH 7.44 , pCO2 32 , and a chest x-ray that showed mild congestive heart failure .
His EKG showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral ST depressions and T waves inversions .
Chest pains were relieved with oxygen by nasal prong , two liters .
He was tansferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin and Diltiazem .
He was ruled in for a non-Q wave MI with peak CKs of 531 , positive for MB .
This course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on 12/17 , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
Quinidine level on 12/16 was 1.4 .
He had a new apical systolic murmur noted on 12/18 .
He had mild CHF , which was treated with Captopril and prn Lasix .
He had recurrent chest pains noted on both 12/17 three times , 12/19 one time , and 12/21 .
The episode on 12/21 was noteworthy for shortness of breath and ST depression in V4-6 which required IV TNG , which was used briefly that night .
On 12/22 , he was transferred to [ORG Norri Hospital  ] for evaluation of his post MI angina .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
B12 IM , iron sulfate 324 mg t.i.d. , Diltiazem 60 q.i.d. , Diabeta 5 mg p.o.q.d. , Quinaglute 324 mg q. 12 hours , one baby aspirin b.i.d. , Halcion 0.25 mg p.o.q.h.s. , Nitrol Paste , Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. , Slow-K two tablets p.o.q.d. , Captopril 0.25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Zantac 115 mg p.o.b.i.d , and Carafate 1 gram p.o.b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .
The patient was pain free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed a left-sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a right-sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
His jugulovenous distention was to 10 centimeters .
His one-year examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the right than the left .
Heart examination showed a PMI , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an S1 and S2 , II/VI systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .
Rectal :
Guaiac positive .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the right and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine of 29/1.4 , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30.9 .
Hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , PT and PTT were 13.4/37.6 , Quinidine was 2.5 , and CKA was 53 .
Pre-intubation ABG was pH of 7.39 , p02 81 , O2 saturation of 96% , C02 29 , total C02 18 .
After intubation his pH was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pC02 28 , total C02 15 .
Repeat ABG done later had a pH of 7.38 p02 of 247 , O2 saturation of 99.9% , pC02 22 , total C02 of 14 .
Magnesium 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride 121 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal EKG changes .
He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
He was pain free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push times four .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg po of Lopressor .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
He had a good urinary output .
His systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his IV fluids were decreased .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate CHF .
The patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
On the above chest x-ray no evidence of dissection was noted .
Even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning .

DISCHARGE DATE :
08-23-92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Intracerebral hemorrhage .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 50 year old , right handed , white male with a history of resection of left cerebellar medulloblastoma , resected six years ago and status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy , with a six month history of 30 pound weight loss , who was admitted to the [ORG Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center  ] with a left basilar ganglion hemorrhage .
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , [PER Pandeprob  ] , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
He had had several months of increased difficulty swallowing and slurred speech .
A recent head computerized tomography scan in 01/92 was negative .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
He was transferred to the [ORG Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center  ] after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .
He had not had any recurrence .
He had history of alcohol abuse in the past .
There was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .
ALLERGIES :
He had no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
A generally cachectic white male , resting quietly with his eyes closed .
His blood pressure was 140/70 , heart rate 75 .
The general medical examination was noted for bilateral temporal wasting .
His oropharynx was clear .
His skin was clear .
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Pulses were 2+ throughout .
The rectal tone was normal with no enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He responded to threat on the left , but not on the right .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
The tongue was midline .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
He had slight decreased corneal reflex on the right .
Motor - right flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella 3 .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was mass effect and some midline shift .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on 07/17/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
There was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on 7/27/92 did not show the mass initially noted .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
The GI Service was consulted on this mass and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
This confirmed an 8 mm. mass which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the right lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
He followed all commands readily .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
HE had an upgoing toe .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
A head computerized tomography scan was repeated on 08/08/92 which revealed some resolution of blood .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Thus , he should return to the [ORG Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center  ] to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in one month to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .
Depending upon his head computerized tomography scan , he will proceed to a brain biopsy if needed .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will be discharged to [ORG Limestrict T Pio Medical Center  ] and will be followed by Dr. [PER Mo Muell  ] in one month in the Neurologic Clinic .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
07-01-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
07-26-93
DISCHARGED TO [ORG SOUTHOBASSKING&apos;S VILLEMARG HOSPITAL  ] .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Ascending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
7/21/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
06/29/93 - white cell scan ; 07/03/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/05/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; 07/05/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; 07-08-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/07/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; 07/09/93 - barium enema ; 7/14/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; 7/15/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 7/21/93 - reopening of sternum ; 07/22/93 - mediastinal exploration .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until 6/15/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to [ORG O Center  ] in [LOC Sondibrid Ey  ] on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to [ORG Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center  ] for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Further evaluation at [ORG Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center  ] , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
In addition , she was evaluated by the [ORG Sileyer Medical Center  ] and there was no evidence of active dental infection .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
Towards the end of June , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on 07/26/93 at 11:10 a.m.
Autopsy permission was granted .

She has been under the care of Dr. [PER Aalv Manual  ] and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor &apos;s office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the [ORG Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center  ] and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the [ORG Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center  ] for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is remarkable for a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .
The carotids were normal .
The chest was clear .
The cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .
The first sound was normal .
The second sound was normally split .
She had no murmurs and no gallops .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
The examination of the extremities showed no edema .
She had good pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .
There were prominent Q-waves in AVL , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .
On 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
She was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
House diet .
No added salt .
Low saturated fat .
Low cholesterol .
ACTIVITY :
As tolerated .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization .
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change .
The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep .
This is her baseline status .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient is an 80 year old female with a history of dementia , and of a choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
She has had these problems for approximately 10 years , and is cared for by a family member .
W / U for Huntington &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Now presents with report of sub-acute worsening of confusion .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
She had a gradual imporvement of her confusion back towards baseline during the hospital stay .
The major therapeutic change during the hospitalization was the starting of zyprexa to see if as part of its side-effect profile it would decrease the choreoathetotic movement symptoms .
Infact , this medication was found to cause a significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

DISCHARGE DATE :
08/15/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 70-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis and peritoneal hemodialysis for ten years , transferred from [ORG Ton University Hospital  ] for further evaluation of change in mental status .
She was admitted to [ORG Aper Hospital  ] for change in mental status on 7/19/2002 .
Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was discharged to rehabilitation and developed disorientation , confusion , incoordination , and apparent paranoia .
She was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with IV Tequin for urinary tract infection .
Throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low-grade temperatures to 99 Fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis .
There was a reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture .
A catheter was subsequently placed for treatment of __________ for three days of ceftazidime .
Herperitoneal fluid cultures have all been negative and showed only 3 polys .
There was a question of 3 x 4 collection around the peritoneal catheter that was investigated with an I+ abdominal CT scan that was not conclusive .
She was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis .
Alumbar puncture of on 07/31/2002 was significant for an opening pressure reported as 12 cm of water .
Only 1 white blood cell was detected , and the fluid was culture and gram stain negative .
Work up also included a negative PPD , Clostridium difficile toxin , blood cultures , and head CT scan .
An electroencephalogram showed nonspecific , left greater than right slowing , without epileptiform spikes .
A Speech and Swallow evaluation initially deemed her an aspiration risk , and she was taken of PO &apos;s .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be 48 .
Lupus anticoagulant was weakly positive , as was a D-dimer .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux .
Peritoneal dialysis x ten years , resulting from that .
And status post right nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy .

She was raised in the [LOC Delaware  ] and spent many years on an organic farm .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , 02 s 96% on room air .
In general , she was well appearing in no apparent distress .
The pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation .
The oropharynx was moist .
The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm .
There was no palpable lymphadenopathy .
The chest was clear bilaterally .
The heart had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with good bowel sounds .
There was no hepatosplenomegaly .
There was no erythema around the catheter site .
There was only mild suprapubic fullness that was not tender .
There was no guarding or rebound .
There was no peripheral edema .
On neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands .
She moved all extremities .
She had decreased strength bilaterally .
She missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose .
There was a questionable positive Babinski on the right side .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
She answered appropriately to yes-no questions , but _____________
She appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .
Her liver function tests were all within normal limits .
Her coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .
Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
The differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
Abdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
Head CT scan on 07/30/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
Work up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take PO &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO &apos;s with one to one supervision .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .
No obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. [PER Pa  ] of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .
CA-125 levels were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the [ORG Termarimed  ] pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

Total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingooophorectomy , bilateral lymph node dissection , omentectomy , lysis of adhesions , removal of mass from surface of transverse colon .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
64-year-old G5P5 postmenopausal for 10 years with a history of two months of progressive abdominal distention , crampy abdominal pain , urinary frequency and diarrhea .
The patient has not obtained gynecologic care for 32 years until April 2004 when an increase in abdominal GERD and urinary symptoms lead her to initial consultation with Dr. [PER Lentny Farstnappsshee  ] in [LOC Gobrew Street , Denlandcobridclevena , West Virginia 28880  ] .
At that time a pelvic ultrasound was performed showing extensive fluid and clear mass within the pelvi-abdominal cavity .
MRI showed a large fluid filled abdomen with a relatively small mass measuring about 5 to 6 cm in the right pelvis .
At this point she had an elevated CA 125 at 440 and came to Dr. [PER Chabechird  ] for further consultation .

Report Status :
Signed Discharge
Date :
03/24/1995
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. [PER Tennis  ] is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the [ORG Utal Health  ] in 12/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. [PER Kennedy  ] with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
He has had numerous interval admissions to [ORG Shoreale Medical Health  ] for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in 03/93 and 08/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .
He has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times per night but no swelling and no weight gain ( although he has had four-inch increase in his abdominal girth in the past year ) .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. [PER Carbon  ] , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
The morning of admission , he had another episode with waves of nausea , dizziness , light-headedness , and pallor .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .

He had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , hematocrit was 40 , white count 7.18 , platelets 250 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 31 , creatinine 1.5 .
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On 3/22 , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .
He was discharged on March 24th with follow-up of his PT / PTT values on Friday , the 25th , as well as three times a week in the following week , and follow-up with Dr. [PER Most  ] within two weeks .

DIAGNOSIS :
1. Sick sinus syndrome .
2. Pulmonary congestion .
3. Status post mitral valve replacement , with a porcine valve , and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery .
4. Chronic obstructive lung disease .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A temporary pacemaker on 5/4/92 , coronary angiogram and left and right heart catheterization on 5/5/92 , and permanent VVI-pacemaker on 5/6/92 , using an Intermedex pacemaker at 292-03 number , and set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zestril , 10 , b.i.d. , coumadin , to be regulated , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , alternating with 0.25 , every other day , verapamil , 80 , 4 times a day , Asthmacort , four puffs , b.i.d. , Atrovent , 2 puffs , 4 times a day , and quinine sulfate , 325 , q.h.s.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. [PER Melvean Ace  ] .
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .
In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. [PER Times  ] , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
Dr. [PER Avejoh Wierst  ] at the [ORG Pedines Community Hospital  ] found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the [ORG Bri Health  ] for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. [PER Avejoh Wierst  ] and Dr. [PER Em Neighburce  ] .

Unsigned Discharge Date :
07/31/1997
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
ASCENDING AORTIC DISSECTION PROCEDURE PERFORMED :
07/26/97 , repair of chronic type A aortic dissection with selective circulatory arrest using a right axillary artery cannulation and innominate artery occlusion , reconstruction of non coronary sinus ( super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 ) , reinforced with felt strip .
Primary repair of atrioseptal defect , patent foramen ovale .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. [PER List  ] is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On December 29 , 1996 , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to [ORG Drain Hospital  ] .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
The patient was transferred to [ORG En&apos;s Healthcare  ] for work-up .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
The patient refused surgery per report .
January 2 CT scan of the chest showed a type III descending thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal to the left subclavian artery and ending above the renal artery .
January 4 , a CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , parenchymal consolidation right greater than left , aortic dissection with true and false lumens , well delineated flap with compression of the true lumen secondary to mass effect of thrombus in the false lumen .
There was a mediastinal hematoma .
There was a low density abnormality surrounding the ascending aorta .
January 23 , 1996 , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient reports having been hospitalized for approximately one month , at which time she was discharged to a nursing home after refusing surgery .
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion since January , 1996 , increasing in the last month , and increasing abdominal distention .
The patient denies history of myocardial infarction or chest pain .
She does have shortness of breath and pedal edema .
She has had atrial fibrillation for five years .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She does orthopnea of three to four pillows .
No syncope but she occasionally has dizziness .
The patient underwent CT scan on Jul 24 , 1997 , which demonstrated dissection of the ascending and archaorta to the root .
CT scan also demonstrated stable descending thoracic dissection with resolution of luminal compression .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with irregular heart rate at 96 .
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
Neck showed 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits , increased jugular venous distention .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
Holosystolic murmur , II / VI , at the left lower sternal border .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
There was pedal edema to the ankles bilaterally .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
Neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Liver function tests were within normal limits .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 102 with an old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
Given her history reported from outside source of a bleeding diathesis , Hematology consult was obtained who felt that she had no evidence of qualitative abnormality orcoagulopathy .
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient received periprocedure antibiotics .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on Jul 25 , 1997 , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
The ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on Jul 25 , 1997 , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Evidence of atrioseptal defect again was noted with a calculation of 2:1 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on Jul 26 , 1997 , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
Postoperatively the patient did require epinephrine and Levophed as well as resuscitation , multiple blood products .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
She has worked well with Physical Therapy with regard to ambulation and has tolerated a regular diet without difficulty .
The patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation postoperatively .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
Her chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated bilateral small effusions , right greater than left .
On 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .
She will follow-up with Dr. [PER Spotted  ] in four to six weeks ; with her cardiologist in one week .

HOSPITAL COURSE and OUTCOME :
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and commenced amiodarone loading .
Adenosine stress MIBI revealed a small reversible defect in the PDA territory and the patient underwent coronary catheterisation on 1/6/0004 which revealed a 70% lesion in the SVG to PDA -&gt; cypher stented successfully .
He had occasional ventricular extopyon telemetry but no further recurrence of ventricular tachycardia .
During his admission , his am fasting glucose levels were intermittently elevated and his HbA1C was greater than 7 .
I have explained to him that he may have developed some glucose intolerance and that , in the first instance , he should see his Primary Care Physician and attempt dietary control .
On the day prior to discharge he noticed a small area of erythema surrounding his R antecubital venous access site .
This will be treated empirically with a 10 day course of Keflex .
I have instructed him to see his PCP if it does not improve in a few days or if he develops fevers .
In terms of his amiodarone , he will be discharged on 400mg po bid for a further 7 days followed by 400mg qd thereafter .
He will followup with Dr. [PER Levels  ] in device clinic in 4 weeks .
I have advised him that he must not drive until he is seena gain in clinic and his device interrogated .

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray 10/10/97 :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
Postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .
The patient also had a shoulder film done on 10/10/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on 10/10/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
Two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .
The fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
No scapular fractures were present .
EKG :
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
Ventricular bigeminy was also seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at [ORG Bri Health  ] in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. [PER Fordwoodall Stick  ] , in [LOC Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156  ] .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in [LOC Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848  ] through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at [ORG Bri Health  ] , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , good .

The patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the [ORG Daleglo Medical Center  ] with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in April of 1997 .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
In 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
On arrival to the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination her pulse was 55 .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .
BUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to [ORG Goman 25  ] where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The patient had been followed by Dr. [PER Friednantflirt  ] of the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
However , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to [ORG Naplesvillechaelty  ] .
I will get in touch with Dr. [PER Areas  ] and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .
My direct pager is 935-131-3314 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of psychotic depression with paranoia who presents status post a few days of incontinence , increased confusion , and collapse .
The patient who has a baseline mental status / psychiatric impairment was reported to be increasingly confused and paranoid over the past few days .
She was reportedly incontinent of urine and diaphoretic .
The family also reported that the patient &quot; collapsed &quot; one day prior to admission , as her legs gave out .
Her PO intake has also decreased .
She was brought to the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] Emergency Ward by ambulance , where she was found to be confused , oriented to self and family only , and with dry mucous membranes .
The head computerized tomography scan on admission to the emergency room revealed moderate to severe cortical atrophy without evidence of acute bleed or subdural hemorrhage .
The patient denies shortness of breath , chest pain or abdominal pain .
The patient has a history of major depression / psychotic depression since at least 1988 .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has a history of near syncope in 1988 and also a history of dehydration .
Currently the patient is unable to provide history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As outlined above .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
vitamin B12 shots monthly .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Mother with depression .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Elderly obese woman lying comfortably in bed in no acute distress .
The vital signs revealed blood pressure 150/83 , heart rate 84 , respirations 20 per minute and temperature 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
revealed one plus edema bilaterally .
The neurological examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented only to self .
She answers inappropriately to questions .
She is not cooperative with the full neurological examination but she did move all four extremities .
LABORATORY DATA :
revealed sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26.4 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose was 124 .
The amylase was 37 .
The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
The prothrombin time was 10.1 and partial thromboplastin time 28.5 .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with axis of 0 degrees and normal intervals .
There were no ST-T wave changes .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse cortical atrophy , increased ventricles and no acute bleed .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
2. Infectious Disease .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
3. Psychiatric .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
This evaluation revealed a woman with multifaceted loss of intellectual functioning who falls well within the range of SDAT group .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. [PER Lornsook Trusmoag  ] , PhD , telephone number 959-1490 .
She stated that she would be happy to reevaluate Ms. [PER Fleetheesc  ] in the future if necessary .
4. Parotid swelling .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant right parotid swelling .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not rule out malignancy .
They recommended that a cytology sample be obtained and sent and that the patient be treated with a 14 day course of Keflex .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the mass had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. [PER Freieslowkays  ] .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [PER Freieslowkays  ] on January 8 , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the [ORG Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital  ] .
The phone number is 610-7597 .
5. Physical Therapy .
The patient &apos;s baseline is that she is able to walk with the assistance of her brother or sister at home .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
vitamin B12 shots q. month , Colace 100 mg PO t.i.d. and Carafate one gram PO q.i.d.

ALLERGIES :
THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO CODEINE WHICH CAUSES NAUSEA AND VOMITING .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , physical examination was revealing for a temperature of 97.5 , heart rate 102 , blood pressure 176/61 , respiratory rate 20 and saturation 95% on room air .
The patient was pleasant elderly white female slightly hard of hearing .
Physical exam otherwise was remarkable for bilateral carotid bruits , bibasilar crackles and faint expiratory wheezes .
Heart rate was regular , S1 and S2 were normal , 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the carotids .
There was trace pedal edema on the left greater than right and tenderness of the left lateral malleolus without pain with flexion of ankle or compromise of distal pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for a white count of 16.87 , hematocrit of 32.8 and platelets of 436,000 .
The differential on the white count was 80% PMNs , 14% bands and 5% lymphocytes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A CAT scan of the abdomen was obtained and showed multiple small adrenal nodules with the greatest one being 0.8 cm .
There is an atrophic pancreas with 3 low attenuation lesions .
The pylorus was thickened without mass or lymphadenopathy .
There was sigmoid diverticulosis and tortuous calcified aorta .
The patient was admitted to the general medical service and GI consultation was obtained .
On September 17 , 2001 , the patient had an upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound .
Ultrasonographic findings included an eccentric wall thickening in the region of the pylorus without focal masses or extrinsic compressions .
The patient underwent balloon dilatation of the pyloric stenosis initially from 8 to 10 and then from 10 to 12 mm .
Biopsies were taken from the pylorus .
Pathological findings from the biopsy revealed antral type mucosa with chronic gastritis and diffuse intestinal metaplasia without Helicobacter pylori microorganisms seen .
There was no evidence of malignancy .
Over the next several days , the patient &apos;s diet was slowly advanced but she continued to vomit after taking large meals .
Therefore , on September 22nd , she once again underwent a dilatation now to 15 mm and after that procedure she was able to tolerate small feedings of soft foods .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a long history of alcohol abuse , withdrawal seizures , and hypopharyngeal cancer now admitted with foreign body in hypopharynx .
The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past .
The patient also recently ( 06/93 ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo XRT but had not yet started .
Recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor .
On the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his XRT and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king .
The patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth .
He denied any shortness of breath at that time .
He was transferred to [ORG Stamgibonnole Hospital  ] for further evaluation .
In the Emergency Room the patient underwent EGD by GI where a large piece of chicken was visualized at the level of the cricopharyngeus .
Despite multiple attempts at extraction at that point they were unable to extract the foreign body and it was felt that the patient should be admitted and attempt extraction later in the afternoon .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Alcohol abuse complicated by hepatitis , cirrhosis , seizure disorder , encephalopathy .
2) History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Hypertension .
4) Hypopharyngeal cancer .
5) Chronic right lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray noted to be probable scarring vs. fat pad .
6) Question of internal capsule CVA on CT scan .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , shellfish , Doxycycline , also the patient had rash with Ceclor .
MEDICATIONS :
On transfer included Dilantin 100 mg po t.i.d. , Ceclor , Motrin , Percocet p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission he is a disheveled elderly male uncooperative with the exam .
Vital signs revealed the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 150/90 , pulse 86 and regular , respiratory rate 24 , and oxygen saturation 91% on room air .
HEENT exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive .
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , no rales .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Abdominal exam obese , hypoactive bowel sounds , non-tender , some guarding , no rebound tenderness .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission Hct 42.1 , white count 7.6 , platelets 132 .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 .
LFTs revealed ALT of 44 , AST of 36 , LDH of 277 , alk phos 155 , total bili 0.7 , and direct bili 0.4. Total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By systems -
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient &apos;s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .
Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient &apos;s poor prognosis for the future .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .
7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
He underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .
The last PT and PTT on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 .
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES :
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 .
COMPLICATIONS :
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
2) GI bleed .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .
DISPOSITION :
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient is stable on discharge .
The patient is to be transferred to [ORG Paw.ryfear Medical Center  ] for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Pepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with Jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals .
Feeding tube should be flushed q4h with 20 to 30 cc of warm water to prevent clogging of feeding tube .

On consultation the patient admitted to dysphasia and periods of diplopia in the past .
The patient was found to have weakness in the proximal muscles as well as the capability of the muscles .
He was started on IV ig and IV Solu-Medrol for a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis given his past history of thymoma .
He markedly improved after a dose of Mestinon .
He completed a five-day course of IV ig .
His work up included acetylcholine esterase , receptor antibodies , thyroglobulin antibody is pending .
An ANA and rheumatoid factor were negative .
Sed rate was 58 and repeat 75 .
EMG studies were performed , the result is pending at the time of this dictation .
He also had a repeat chest CT which showed a question of recurrence of the thymoma .
Thoracic Surgery was consulted and recommended repeating the CT scan in six weeks as an outpatient .
This could represent either recurrence of scar tissue .
The patient was tapered to p.o. prednisone and tolerated Mestinon 30 mg q. 4h with 180 mg longacting at bedtime .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and mitral stenosis .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Intubation .
Echocardiogram .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Ms. [PER Pa  ] is a 67 year old woman with a history notable for congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , transient ischemic attacks and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Over the few months prior to admission the patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and increasing weight gain to the tune of approximately 30 lbs despite increasing diuresis by her primary care physician .
An echocardiogram at the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] in 1997 revealed a normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormality .
By her primary care physicians report an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in June 1999 revealed mild left atrial enlargement and mild right ventricular dilatation .
The primary care physician also reports an increasing new mitral regurgitation murmur over the past several weeks .
The patient has a Persantin Thallium stress test at an outside hospital on 11/22/99 which reportedly was negative for ischemia .
She has had no chest pain .
She does not smoke and has no history of coronary artery disease .
Three days prior to admission , secondary to increasing difficulty with ambulation and dyspnea on exertion the patient was admitted to a nursing home .
Outside the hospital the patient is non-compliant with her diet running her sugars in the 200s despite NPH insulin .
On arrival to the nursing home she was fed an in-house diet which was markedly less coloric and sugar filled than her home diet .
Early on the morning of admission the patient was found down , diaphoretic and responsive only to sternal rub .
She had a witnessed seizure-like episode .
Her blood sugar was 48 .
Emergency Medical Service was called .
The patient was intubated , given thiamine and D50 as well as intravenous Lasix and she was transferred to the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] Emergency Room .
In the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] Emergency Room she was afebrile with a blood pressure 150/80 , heart rate in the 60s , oxygen saturation of 100% .
She was arousable to sternal rub only .
She had minimal crackles bilaterally and had an unremarkable electrocardiogram .
Her chest x-ray showed only mild failure .
She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy , nephropathy and retinopathy status post laser treatment .
Severe degenerative joint disease of the spine and knees .
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation given a history of gastrointestinal bleed .
Upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Hypercholesterolemia status post multiple transient ischemic attacks in the past , status post a right hemiparesis which has now resolved on aspirin .
Mild chronic dementia .
History of supraventricular tachycardia in 06/99 felt secondary to Desipramine toxicity .
Magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time notable only for chronic white matter changes .
Congestive heart failure .
Depression .
Hypertension .
Hypothyroidism .
Endometrial hyperplasia .
Fibromyalgia .
Left breast mass with negative mammography .
Essential tremor .
Glaucoma .
ALLERGIES :
Relafen which is contra-indicated because of ulcers .
Ultram .
Tetracycline .
Melphalan .
Bactrim .
Desipramine which causes supraventricular tachycardia .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives in a nursing home .
No alcohol use .
No drug use .
No tobacco use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was arousable to voice .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
She was moving all four extremities .
Toes were down going bilaterally .
Vital signs :
temperature 95.1 F , heart rate 89 beats per minute in sinus rhythm .
Blood pressure 165/90 .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
Neck supple and non-tender without thyromegaly or nodules .
2+ carotid pulses without bruits .
Jugular venous pressure 10 cm .
Lungs with crackles bilaterally up the lung field .
Heart regular rate and rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur with question of an opening snap .
A diastolic murmur was noted by one listener .
Abdomen had mild right upper quadrant tenderness with positive bowel sounds .
Rectal was guaiac positive .
Extremities had marked pitting edema bilaterally .
Right heel ulcer with eschar .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Plasma sodium 134 , plasma carbon dioxide 34.8 , blood urea nitrogen 67 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 165 , liver function tests were normal .
Amylase 473 , lipase 6.8 , white blood cell count 7.4 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 222 .
Urine analysis showed no urinary tract infection .
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate and minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid lung zone .
KUB showed no bowel obstruction .
Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By system .
1. ENDOCRINE :
The patient &apos;s seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
She will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a CZI sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
Her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital .
She did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
She was continued on her Trazodone , Neurontin and Zyprexa .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities but mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 19 and mean gradient of 9 , dilated right ventricle , dilated right atrium , and right ventricle systolic pressure in the 60s .
She was aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema .
After discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient .
4. PULMONARY :
The patient was extubated quickly after her admission and maintained good oxygen saturation .
She was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure .
5. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase .
These findings suggest some bowel pathology .
The patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin .
An outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated .
6. RENAL :
The patient maintained her baseline creatinine which reflects chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her diabetes .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was treated on Unasyn for concern of cellulitis .
The patient &apos;s lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis .
However she did have a low grade temperature to 100F and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be covered for possible cellulitis .
She will be discharged on a one week course of Augmentin .
The patient was discharged to her chronic care facility on 11/27/99 in stable condition .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Albuterol nebs 2.5 mg po q4h as needed .
2. Atrovent nebs .5 mg four times per day as needed .

9/3/96 , transverse colostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
[PER Daie Elms  ] was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; hypertension ; peripheral vascular disease ; coronary artery disease ; bilateral vitrectomies ; cadaveric renal transplant ; suprapubic tube for ureteral necrosis ; status post right below-knee amputation and left below-knee amputation ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; left arm arteriovenous fistula .

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Cyclosporin A .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Minipress .
Digoxin .
Pravachol .
Imuran .
Lasix .
Epogen .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
His blood pressure was 174/60 ; temperature 103.4 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was remarkable for poor dentition .
The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. [PER Elms  ] was admitted to the hospital , and after multiple cultures were drawn , he was subsequently taken to the operating room on 8/21/96 for incision and drainage of a right thigh abscess .
There appeared to be a component of necrotizing fasciitis to this , and he was taken back to the operating room the next day for incision and drainage of a pelvic abscess and intraabdominal abscess .
Cultures from his abdomen subsequently grew out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On 9/3/96 , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
On 11/26/96 , the patient had a hypotensive bradycardic arrest at the end of a dialysis run .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
Over the next two days , Mr. [PER Elms  ] was kept comfortable and given intravenous fluids and tube feeds , but he remained extremely ill .
He continued to deteriorate until 12/3/96 , at which time he became bradycardic and asystolic .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on 12/3/96 .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .

Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
A perisplenic effusion was noted which appeared to communicate with the lesser sac collection .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On 4/17/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. [PER Mass  ] was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. [PER Mass  ] was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained stable from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with po intake .
He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of June , it became clear that Mr. [PER Mass  ] would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. [PER Mass  ] , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. [PER Douet  ] at [ORG Vassdiysey Medical Center  ] , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to [ORG Vassdiysey Medical Center  ] .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
History of multinodular goiter ; history of hypertension ; history of subtotal thyroidectomy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Electrical cardioversion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. [PER Lenkpruskihkooglekih  ] is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance .
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% .
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until October of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance .
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on 11/16/96 .
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes a history of hypertension ; multinodular goiter ; subtotal thyroidectomy .
MEDICATIONS :
Include Cardizem CD 180 mg daily ; Monopril 10 mg daily ; Digoxin .25 mg daily ; and Lasix 40 mg every other day .
ALLERGIES :
To Quinidine , Procardia , and sulfa antibiotics .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination , blood pressure was 200/100 ; heart rate 120 per minute ( atrial fibrillation ) .
The patient was noted to be anxious .
There was no neck vein distension or carotid bruits .
Heart sounds were normal .
The lungs were clear .
The abdominal examination was benign .
There was no peripheral edema .
Pulses were all easily palpable .
LABORATORY DATA :
A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a QT interval of .46 seconds .
There were diffuse ST segment and T-wave abnormalities , which were nonspecific .
A complete blood count , electrolytes , BUN and creatinine were within normal limits .
INR was elevated at 2.5 .
An echocardiogram was performed , which showed completely normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction calculated at .74 .
There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or asymmetric septal hypertrophy , which had been an issue that had been raised on an echocardiogram in [LOC Ownra Cin , New Mexico  ] on 12/06/96 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this .
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules .
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days .
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on 12/29/96 .
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today .
The patient will follow up with Dr. [PER Ther Ludzjesc  ] at [ORG Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers  ] in [LOC Connecticut  ] .
In addition , she will return to this hospital in early February for repeat attempt at electrical cardioversion on Amiodarone .
She will continue her Coumadin until then and arrangements for her readmission can be made through Dr. [PER Iceca Rhaltkaaispehbreun  ] &apos;s office here .
MEDICATIONS :
Other than the addition of Amiodarone 200 mg daily , will be the same as her admission medications .

DISCHARGE DATE :
02/28/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tuberculosis in childhood .
(2) Hepatic encephalopathy .
(3) Grade I esophageal varices .
(4) Hepatic hydrothorax on the right .
(5) peptic ulcer disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Repeated pleurocentesis .
Chest tube placement on the right .
Endotracheal intubation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .
The patient has been admitted multiple times with this symptom , and in this setting , was called in to the hospital by his primary care doctor on the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath , and dyspnea on exertion .
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
The chest tube was removed , but then replaced on the 14th of February , and maintained a continuous and large volume output .
The patient was evaluated by the Liver Transplant Service , and on the end of his first week of admission , became increasingly somnolent with exam findings consistent with evolving hepatic encephalopathy .
This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the 17th of February , 1997 .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
He has not been considered as a candidate for a TIPPS or for pleurodesis , given his position at the top of the transplant list for his blood type , B .
Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. [PER Hibbslires  ] was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .
During the first week of February in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
He became dependent on pressers .
On the 26th of February , the patient had an extremely large volume gastrointestinal bleed , and worsened hepatic encephalopathy .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. [PER Leynslentnerswaimjesc  ] and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. [PER Loydbreunlinke  ] , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
On the 27th of February , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the 27th of February , 1997 .
The family was present .
Dr. [PER Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau  ] , and [PER Launtburce  ] were notified .

There was mild flattening in V5 and V6 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Problem #1 was cardiac .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and electrocardiogram .
He had multiple episodes during hospitalization of chest pain radiating to the back , during which his vital signs remained stable and there were no electrocardiogram changes .
His pain resolved with nitroglycerin sublingually and occasional MSO4 intravenously .
An exercise tolerance test was performed and the patient went 7 minutes 6 seconds and was terminated secondary to fatigue .

8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at [ORG Petersly Hospital And Medical Center  ] .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in [LOC DE  ] is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .
He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the [ORG Petersly Hospital And Medical Center  ] .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to [ORG Huyychestleme Health Of  ] in [LOC Scoo , Utah  ] where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to [ORG Lorough Medical Center  ] &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .

Glucose 191 .
PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Prostate cancer .
2. Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient is an 87-year-old male with stage D prostate was cancer , was admitted for fluid hydration on the 10th of March .
The patient was initially diagnosed with prostate cancer in August of 1989 .
He presented with gross hematuria at that time .
Subsequent prostatic biopsy revealed a Gleason &apos;s IV , plus V tumor and the CT showed an irregular large prostate with tumor invasion into the bladder and evidence of bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node spread .
There was also evidence of bone metastasis at that time .
The patient was admitted in October of 1991 for urinary retention and acute renal failure and was treated with fluid rehydration and Foley catheter placement .
Over the past one month prior to admission , the patient &apos;s wife has noticed a marked decrease in p.o. intake and also noted a weight loss of approximately ten pounds in the preceding two weeks .
The patient has been lethargic and bed ridden for the past two weeks , although there was no evidence of fever or chills over this time .
The patient is now admitted for fluid rehydration therapy and observation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS :
None currently .
ALLERGIES :
None .
HABITS :
No history of cigarette smoking .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is afebrile with a recumbent blood pressure of 128/16 , pulse of 76 , and standing blood pressure of 110/60 with a pulse of 88 .
Respirations are unlabored at 16 .
HEENT :
Noted for nonicteric sclerae and lungs that are clear to auscultation .
No CVA tenderness was appreciated in the heart and the heart appears to be in regular rate and rhythm .
EXTREMITIES :
Without cyanosis or edema .
ABDOMEN :
Soft and nontender .
SKIN :
Decreased turgor with dry mucous membranes .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count of 7.75 , hematocrit of 46.2% , sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , creatinine 25 , and BUN was 1.4 with a blood sugar of 88 .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.&apos; s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient &apos;s fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient &apos;s electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.&apos; s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to [ORG El Hospital  ] to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to [ORG El Hospital  ] , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .

6) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 88 year-old woman undergoing treatment for a right lower extremity cellulitis who was transferred from [ORG Child  ] for worsening cellulitis and new confusion .
The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and was recently admitted to the [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] for a Nafcillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis of the right leg treated with a course of Nafcillin and Levofloxacin .
There was also a right leg fluid collection that was incised and drained on August 1 , 1998 .
The patient was sent to rehabilitation on Levofloxacin orally .
Although details were not available at the time of admission , apparently , she had done well until the 24 hours proceeding admission when the cellulitis was felt to be worsening .
She had also been noted to be confused and combative during that 24 hour period .
As her baseline mental status is completely alert and oriented , this caused concern amongst the staff of the rehabilitation center and the patient was transferred to the [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] .

ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is presently staying at the [ORG Gangistown Hospital Center  ] .
She has a son who is actively involved in her care .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Physical examination on admission revealed an elderly woman , sleeping , responsive only to noxious stimuli after having received some sedation in the emergency department .
Vital signs :
Heart rate 60 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 116/80 , temperature 97.1 degrees , oxygen saturation 93% on room air .
Head and neck examination was benign .
Skin examination was notable for a leg ulcer and cellulitis to be delineated below .
There were no spider angiomata .
Neck was supple with no thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .
There was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient &apos;s apex to axilla .
There was no S3 appreciated .
Vascular examination was notable for 1+ carotid impulses which were diminished and delayed and the above mentioned transmitted cardiac murmurs .
Abdominal examination revealed that the abdomen was soft , non-tender , non-distended , no organomegaly , no masses , normal active bowel sounds .
The patient &apos;s extremity examination was notable for erythema of the right calf with a small ulcer with a relatively clean base .
Neurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications .
She was arousable only to painful stimuli .
Her pupils were reactive bilaterally .
Her face was symmetric .
She had an intact gag reflex .
She was able to move all four of her extremities in response to pain .
Her deep tendon reflexes were slightly diminished at 1+ bilaterally , but symmetric .
LABORATORY :
The patient &apos;s laboratory data on admission is as follows :
Sodium was 142 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 99 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 .
AST was 25 , alkaline phosphatase 130 , total bilirubin 3.2 , albumin 3.4 , calcium 8.8 .
Digoxin level was 0.8 .
Hematocrit was 33.0 , platelet count 627 , white blood cell count 10,000 , MCV 79.8 .
Coagulation studies revealed a PT of 17.4 seconds with an INR of 2.1 , PTT 25.5 .
The patient &apos;s admission chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate , no congestive heart failure .
Head CT scan performed in the emergency department revealed no bleed .
Urinalysis revealed trace microscopic hematuria with 47 red blood cells per high powered field , 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
A neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .
The Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .
The patient &apos;s mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , August 16 , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .
A neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .
The patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck CT scan .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s mental status is back to its baseline .
2) Right lower extremity cellulitis :
The patient was evaluated by the Surgical Service who felt that the wound was clean with some erythema but without evidence of true cellulitis .
The patient &apos;s antibiotics were discontinued with the thought that prolonged antibiotics only put her at more risk for infection .
3) Cardiac :
The patient has a history of critical aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation .
Fortunately , these issues were not active during the present admission .
4) Status post fall :
The patient did fall while inhouse .
A head CT scan and cervical spine series were negative .
The patient appeared to have no deficits at the time of discharge .
5) Atrial fibrillation :
The patient &apos;s Coumadin was continued .

8. History of perforated gastric ulcer treated with hemigastrectomy 03/2004 .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Radiation therapy to the right clavicle 07/16/2004 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several [ORG PUOMC  ] admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
She had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .
Not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .
She ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .
She had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .
There had been no focal neurologic changes .
Up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
Her lungs were clear .
She had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
The rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .
Bilirubin normal .
Her ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .
Her alk phos slightly up at 174 .
WBC 10.8 with normal differential .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345,0000 .
A urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .
A CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
The patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .
This was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
A single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .
PLAN :
Escalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o&apos;clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. [PER First  ] &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .
Doculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. Colace 100 mg b.i.d. Senna syrup two teaspoonfuls b.i.d. Mylanta 15-30 mg p.r.n. dyspepsia .
Tylenol 1-2 tabs q.4 p.r.n. pain .
Multivitamin , Megace 200 mg p.o. q.d. ( appetite stimulant ) .
Nexium 20 mg q.d. Femora ( letrazole ) 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Polyethylene glycol ( Miralax ) 17 gm p.o. q.d. Dilaudid 4 mg p.o. q.4 hours p.r.n. breakthrough pain .
Fragmin 5000 units subq b.i.d. Oxycodone controlled-release ( OxyContin ) 10 mg p.o. q.12 hours .
Dexedrine 5 mg p.o. at 8 a.m.
The patient was discharged in improved , stable , satisfactory condition with the expectation that she will call Dr. [PER First  ] &apos;s office for a followup visit in about two weeks .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from [ORG Capa An- Medical Center  ] of [LOC Ohio  ] on 07/20 for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
On 08/10/90 the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on 02/92 .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
On 07/19/92 the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
On 07/19/92 direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea .
They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at [ORG Asney Ewood Health Care  ] in [LOC Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U  ] and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
Dr. [PER Fields  ] was consulted and the patient was transferred by [ORG Ton Len N&apos;ss Community Hospital  ] to [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. [PER Fields  ] on 07/20 in the p.m.
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Respiratory :
The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until 7/21/92 .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room where bronchoscopy was done .
The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords .
The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .
The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask .
The patient generally breaths between 20 and 30 breaths per minute and is otherwise stable .
Cardiac :
The patient is otherwise stable .
The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .
Fluids and Nutrition :
The patient was initially NPO and then begun on Pediasure feeds the first two days of hospitalization .
The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food .
The patient generally does not drink much fluid .
GI :
From a gastrointestinal point of view please note on ______________ at 5 a.m. the patient was noted to be aspirating bits of cereal and juices via his trach tube .
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds .
The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress .
The patient was made NPO on 7/25 a.m. Dr. [PER Fields  ] &apos;s team is coming to evaluate the patient .
Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future .
The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days .
KUB on 7/23 showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema .
The patient last received enema on 7/24 in the p.m.
HEM :
The patient has generally been stable .
His initial hematocrit was 31% .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The platelet count was 351,000 .
The patient never received blood during the procedure .
The estimated blood loss was minimal .
Renal :
The patient has always had good urine output with normal BUN and creatinine .
Neurological :
The patient has a history of of seizure disorder .
He has been stable here .
He is presently being weaned off his Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol by his Neurologist in [LOC Vanri , SC  ] .
Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 .
The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future .
Phenobarbital has been maintained by intravenous 30 mg b.i.d.
Infectious Disease :
The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in [LOC Mississippi  ] .
The patient was switched over to Ancef to cover for Staph and usual flora for possible pneumonia .
The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 .
Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable .
The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative .
The patient cannot be cathed as he has a recent hypospadias repair .
The patient is still being maintained on Ancef at the request of Dr. [PER Fields  ] &apos;s team .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient will be transferred to [ORG Ral Medical Center  ] in [LOC Saintarv  ] on 7/25/92 by ambulance .
The patient has a 3-0 Shiley in place that is stitched to his neck and also has trach ties in places .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. [PER Fields  ] will contact Dr. [PER Roosekote  ] as to probable plans .
It appears that Dr. [PER Fields  ] wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time .
The parents are being transferred back to [LOC Newstonpend  ] to learn trach care and to set up homecare .
If you have any questions please contact me .

Admission Date :
06/11/1991
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
06/22/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram times two .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at [ORG Vanor  ] .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. [PER Mielke  ] , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to [ORG Weekscook University Medical Center  ] with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
CHEST :
Few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
ABDOMEN :
Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .
She was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in [LOC Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961  ] for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. [PER Mielke  ] and home care services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Premarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. , MS Elixir 100 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. , Robitussin with Codeine 5 cc p.o. q.2h. , and home O2 two liters via nasal prong with increase to four liters as needed for symptoms p.r.n.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Esophageal carcinoma-metastatic .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lymphangetic pulmonary carcinomatosis , dyspnea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Bronchoscopy , 3/23/95 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. [PER Po  ] is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
Briefly , Mr. [PER Po  ] presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the May of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By October of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
He began Ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease .
Over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He has seen two local physicians , who have tried him first on Bactrim and subsequently Clarithromycin without improvement .
He denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Remarkable for a history of ulcers .
2) Inferior vena cava occlusion .
3) Arthritis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atrovent , Proventil , Azmacort , Serevent inhalers .
Coumadin , Tagamet , and Clarithromycin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient is afebrile , tachypneic , and tachycardic .
Skin is pale .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis .
He has total alopecia .
His neck is supple .
There is no thyroid , cervical , or supraclavicular adenopathy .
His lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest .
There is minimal air movement on the left lower lobe .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory studies on admission included a BUN and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 .
PT was 19.8 seconds .
His three liter nasal prong blood gas revealed a PO2 of 63 , PCO2 of 47 , pH of 7.39 .
A chest X-ray revealed diffuse air space disease , particularly on the left .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. [PER Jesclinke  ] on 4/22/95 .
Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions .
BAL was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms .
A few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous Bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .
This was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and Ativan .
The patient was discharged on Mar 30 , 1995 with hospice care .
His status is DNR .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tagamet , 800 mg. PO q.day ; five liters of supplemental oxygen ; Carafate , 1 gm. b.i.d. ; Ativan , 1 mg. SL q.4 p.r.n.

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
[PER Granrivern Call  ] is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. [PER Flo Cuchkote  ] at the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .

vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .

SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [PER Ria  ] in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
02/06/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CHORDOMA .
PROCEDURE :
1/22/97 Right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor with laminectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. [PER Marker  ] is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain .
An initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in August , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass .
In September , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .
He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .
A follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .
He was treated with aspirin .
November 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .
Postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .
He was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on December 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .
Now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .
He is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .
DIET :
Jevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube , some liquids .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to Codeine which causes nausea and Morphine which causes swelling .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Denies use of alcohol and tobacco .
He is married and lives in [LOC Nebraska  ] , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .
General :
This is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed .
HEENT , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema .
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Abdomen G-tube intact , soft non-tender , active bowel sounds .
Neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement .
Cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .
Strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
Cerebella intact .
Gait steady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on Jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .
A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
A lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
He was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .
He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. [PER Marker  ] about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .
Prior to admission Mr. [PER Marker  ] had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. [PER Marker  ] did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.
He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .
FOLLOW-UP :
Follow-up will be with Dr. [PER Sick  ] in one weeks time .
He will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .
ADDENDUM
Mr. [PER Marker  ] will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
[PER LESS , LIESEANALE  ]
UNIT NUMBER :
589-25-50
ADMISSION DATE :
12/16/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/16/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Right nephrectomy .
2. Cadaveric renal transplant .
3. Acute thrombosis .
4. Transplant nephrectomy .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
10. Perforated viscus .
11. Abdominal abscesses .
12. Sepsis .
13. Respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. [PER Less  ] continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. [PER Less  ] condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. [PER Cantsleddjesc  ] felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 .

IDENTIFICATION :
Mr. [PER Kotefyfe  ] is a 65-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome ( acute myelogenous leukemia ) who presents 20 days status post a nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplant and is admitted for fatigue , neutropenia , and an abnormal chest x-ray .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In January 2002 , the patient was found to be anemic .
He was monitored closely and started on folic acid .
In August 2002 , a bone marrow biopsy showed MDS with a 12p abnormality in 14/24 metaphases .
He was treated with 5-azacytidine due to increasing number of blasts .
After four treatment cycles , his marrow remained hypercellular with persistent low levels of blasts .
In September 2004 , the patient converted to AML with Philadelphia chromosome 9:12 and received induction chemotherapy and recovered slowly with blasts .
In November 2005 , a bone marrow biopsy showed 80% cellularity and 40% of the intratrabecular space was composed of AML cells .
Hydrea was started due to splenic pain .
The patient was admitted on December 5 , 2005 for many &quot; peripheral blood stem cell transplants . &quot;
This course was without major complications .
Since his discharge from the hospital one week ago , he had twin graft to stem cells .
He has had only a few polys on his white blood cell differential .
He has also had persistent blasts of 1 to 2% .
The patient was taken off GMCSF because of splenic pain and this pain improved .
He has not been febrile .
He has had transfusions on several occasions .
His white blood cell count and platelet count have been noted to be steadily rising over the past week .
He actually looked a little bit better today than he had previously .
For the past three days , he has been complaining of pain in his shoulder with motion and also a little bit of pain in his left lower quadrant .
A chest x-ray obtained demonstrated a right lobe infiltrate , which was possibly fungal in etiology and the patient has been admitted for further evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
AML , coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in 1989 with stent placement , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and scrofula in a lymph node .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , which causes a rash .

Chest CAT scan was notable for right upper lobe consolidation and right pleural effusion .
All findings consistent with pneumonia .
HOSPITALIZATION COURSE :
Mr. [PER Lyfranklapalm Kote  ] is a 65-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome that could vary to acute myelogenous leukemia who is status post a nonmyeloablative allogenic transplants via protocol of 27-518 , the GVAX study , who was readmitted for right upper lobe infiltrate .
The remainder of the dictation will be divided by system :
1. Oncology :
The patient is status post nonmyeloablative &quot; many allogenic bone marrow transplant on 12/12/04 .
Neutrophils have yet twin graft , GMCSF was stopped in a setting of increased splenic pain .
Throughout this admission , the patient has had a climbing level of blasts ( 44% on the day of discharge ) consistent with recurrent leukemic disease .
All immunosuppressants were discontinued except for tacrolimus .
Tacrolimus was continued at a reduced dose to 0.5 mg daily , so that the patient could remain on the GVAX study .
2. ID / Pulmonary :
Admission CAT scans and x-rays of the chest were notable for right upper lobe infiltrate .
The patient was afebrile upon admission and remained afebrile throughout his course .
Infectious Disease and Pulmonary Services were actively involved during this admission .
Both Consultant Services felt the initial imaging was consistent with focal fungal ( question Aspergillus or Mucor ) infiltrates .
He was started empirically .
He was started empirically on Voriconazole .
Given the patient &apos;s history of scrofula , there was mild concern for possible active tuberculosis .
The patient ruled out for TB by serial sputum induction studies .
A bronchoscopy was performed .
Washings , cultures , and viral studies were negative or remained no growth to date .
CMV viral loads were all negative .
Serum galactomannan level on 01/01 was negative .
There was consideration to do a VAT procedure to obtain his definitive diagnosis , but however , in the presence of recurrent leukemic disease , the patient continued to decline this option .
Inpatient antibiotic and antiviral treatment included prophylactic acyclovir and Mepron per protocol , empiric Levaquin , empiric caspofungin , and empiric fluconazole .
The patient does have thrush .
3. Hematology :
The patient had no active bleeding during this admission .
The patient was given red blood cells and platelets to maintain his hematocrit above 26 and his platelet count above 10,000 .
4. Cardiovascular :
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
He had one brief episode of chest pain that was spontaneously resolved .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and no further workup was pursued .
5. Musculoskeletal :
The patient had a right middle finger pain , which developed during this admission without any preceding trauma .
This pain was felt to be due to arthritis .

DIAGNOSES :
HYDROCEPHALUS LEFT FRONTAL ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA
The patient was admitted with the chief complaint of gait ataxia and decline in memory .
The patient is a 71-year-old right-handed white female with a history of confusion and difficulty with speech for about one year .
A CAT scan done at that time , of the head , showed tumor in the left frontal region .
[ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] , Doctor [PER Lou  ] , 02-15-90 , operated and removed the tumor via craniotomy incision .
The patient received radiation therapy and the tumor resolved completely on the CAT scan .
The patient did well until August of 1991 , when a followup CAT scan showed hydrocephalus and symptoms were increasing , of sleep , but she also had a high phenobarbital level .
A lumbar puncture was done ; results are unknown , but with a decrease in her pheno-barbital level she did well .
In October the tumor regrew and the patient received interferon and BCNU therapy until November .
This was limited by her decreasing blood counts .
CAT scan prior to 01/29 , the tumor showed shrinkage of about 80% but increasing hydrocephalus .
The lumbar puncture was ineffective for the treatment of the hydrocephalus .
The patient progressed to be more sleepy , her language was more sparse , she was more confused and weak , and incontinent .
She recurred with some seizures , and underwent admission this time for evaluation for a ventriculo-peritoneal VP shunt placement for the hydrocephalus .

There were five beats of clonus bilaterally .
Gait was decreased arm swing , slightly wide-based , negative Romberg , mildly unsteady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt on 02-19-91 .
She tolerated the procedure well and was actually , the following day , slightly drowsy , but did better than preoperatively while in the hospital .
She was able to ambulate with some assistance , was less sleepy and slow in her affect , able to swallow , passed her swallow study , and had an episode while in the house of shortness of breath , two episodes , with an electrocardiogram that did not show any change , and a chest x-ray showed a question of failure .
For this reason , a cardiology consult was called .
They recommended starting the patient on Lasix and doing cardiac echo .
On Lasix , the patient &apos;s BUN and creatinine started rising , and the echocardiogram revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular hyper-trophy and decreased compliance .
It was felt that the patient was slightly dehydrated .
Lasix was stopped .
The patient did well without any further episodes of shortness of breath , and she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility .

UNIT NUMBER :
083-97-79
ADMISSION DATE :
09/15/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
09/23/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Wolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from [ORG Cay Memorial Hospital Of  ] for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
His cardiac risk factors include :
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in January 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
He subsequently had an echocardiogram in December 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in February 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In December 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. [PER Slusslashgodle  ] which were unsuccessful .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On 9/2/98 he was admitted to [ORG Cay Memorial Hospital Of  ] with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] for further evaluation and management .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Aspirin .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
There was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
He was seen by [ORG Nnoatal Hospital Center  ] who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
There were no complications .
Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .
He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 .
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on [LOC Iat  ] .
FOLLOW-UP :
He will follow-up with Dr. [PER Taarnna Service  ] at [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] as well as Dr. [PER Lupevickette Folk  ] and Dr. [PER Dwainco Rallsversgach  ] on [LOC Villean Garl  ] .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PROGRESSIVE ACANTHAMOEBA INFECTION .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65-year-old man with refractory CLL , status post non-myeloblative stem cell transplant approximately nine months prior to admission , and status post prolonged recent [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] stay for Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , complicated by ARS due to medication toxicity , as well as GVHD and recent CMV infection , readmitted for new fever , increasing creatinine , hepatomegaly and fluid surge spacing , in the setting of hyponatremia .
Patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .
In November , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .
Started Campath in July , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in December , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , August , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
He was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .
Patient was hospitalized September 26 to November 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
ID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .
Subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .
Patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Hypercapture near end of stay was negative .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .
Cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on November 11 , with new fever up to 102.0 in DSCI clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Patient reports no significant changes in how he feels over the past week .

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 129 , creatinine 3.0 , BUN 70 , potassium 5.0 , bicarbonate 23 , chloride 99 , ALT 36 , AST 30 , alkaline phosphatase 215 , total bilirubin 1.1 , albumin 2.6 , white blood cell count 2.0 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelets 60 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9 , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
On November 30 , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. [PER Tomedankell Bile  ] , attending physician , Dr. [PER Mellerny Close  ] , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .
Such measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .
This interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course .

This was followed by radiation .
Inspite of radiation the tumor has progressed and the patient has had intermittent rectal bleeding .
She was last admitted in 06/96 for pelvic fracture which was accompanied by bright red blood per rectum .
At this time she underwent Yag laser electrocautery and a flexible sigmoidoscopy .
Now she presents with similar bright red blood per rectum times one day .
The ostomy site is function with no gross blood , denies any nausea and vomiting or abdominal pain , no fever , chills or anorexia or dizziness .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Remarkable for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the rectum with liver metastases , long standing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , severe pneumonitis , rectal ulcers , and pelvic fracture in 06/96 .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Diverting colostomy , multiple sigmoidoscopies and Yag laser to control bleeding rectal carcinoma times two , one in 06/96 and one for this admission in September .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Tylenol #3 and metered dose inhalers PRN .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
HABITS :
65 pack year smoking history , denies alcohol abuse , however , strongly suspicious that the patient does drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a frail , cachectic woman in no acute distress .
The head and neck exam was unremarkable .
Chest had diffuse crackles and rales with some end expiratory wheezing .
The abdomen was soft , non-tender , nondistended , flat with positive bowel sounds and functioning colostomy in the left lower quadrant with positive stool and gas in the bag .
Anoscope revealed a small 1 cm. laceration without active bleeding in the emergency room .
Her admission vital signs included a blood pressure of 99/54 , pulse 72 , respirations 20 , temperature 98.8 .
LABORATORY DATA :
Remarkable for sodium 139 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 98 , CO2 31.1 , BUN and creatinine 23/.9 respectively , white blood count 8 , hematocrit 31.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted from the emergency room to the floor and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells to bring up her hematocrit to approximately 36 .
On the morning of 10/3/96 at 10:30 in the morning , the patient complained of some mild shortness of breath after infusion of her second unit of packed red blood cells .
Her sat was 94% which was down from her baseline of 96 , two liter nasal prong .
The lungs had mild bibasilar rales , superimposed over baseline wheezes .
It was thought that she may have a touch of congestive heart failure secondary to transfusion .
Her intravenous fluids were held and her breathing was improved with upright posturing .
A chest x-ray showed clear lungs with respect to congestive heart failure .
Therefore the idea of pulmonary embolus was entertained although the patient had no episodes of tachycardia , chest pain or hemoptysis with her shortness of breath .
The lower extremity arterial non-invasive studies were obtained and were negative for deep venous thrombosis .
The patient underwent colonoscopy on 10/4/96 and rectal carcinoma was observed and cauterized with a Yag laser .
This provided adequate hemostasis .
The patient was then observed and discharged that evening on her normal regimen of pain medicine with [ORG Arnsperni Health  ] support for assistance with activities of daily living .
The patient is end stage severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and advanced adenocarcinoma and is do not resuscitate .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of prior anterior myocardial infarction and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from an outside hospital after an episode of acute shortness of breath and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the [ORG Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital  ] after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .
The course had multiple complications requiring pressors .
He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .
The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in April of 1996 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1996 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .
The patient &apos;s was most recently admitted to [ORG Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center  ] on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .
He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .
He called the EMT &apos;s and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at [ORG Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center  ] .
He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .
His ECG showed no ischemic changes .
He was then transferred to the [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus x 15 years with no retinopathy or foot lesions .

He does not drink alcohol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
His mother and father both died secondary to myocardial infarction .
One of his brothers has had a myocardial infarction .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 100.3 , heart rate 76 , blood pressure 100/78 , respiratory rate 16 , and an oxygen saturation of 96% on two liters .
NECK :
No jugular venous distention .
CHEST :
Clear to auscultation with no wheezes or rales .
CARDIOVASCULAR :
Regular rate and rhythm with no extra heart sounds and no murmurs .
ABDOMEN :
Benign .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema with 2+ pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 25 and creatinine 1.4 .
White count 6 and hematocrit 41.5 .
PT 14.1 with an INR of 1.4 , PTT 36.7 .
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates and no pulmonary edema .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 with normal intervals .
He had flat T waves in I and aVL , which were unchanged from previous ECG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema .
It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on 01/17/96 .
At cardiac catheterization he had an RA pressure of 8 , an RV pressure of 52/10 , PA pressure of 60/25 , and wedge of 26 .

His neurological exam deteriorated over the first week of admission to the extent that he was at times responsive to voice by opening his eyes , but was not able to follow commands .
He moved his left side more than his right side in response to stimulation .
Cardiovascularly , he developed atrial fibrillation and hypertension during the hospital course and was managed by Dr. [PER Gach  ] of Cardiology .
Infectious Disease issues included serial fevers of unknown source .
Cultures from multiple sites never grew out any organisms .
He was on antibiotics for several days while in Intensive Care .
Gastrointestinally , he was unable to tolerate tube feeds and was started on total parenteral nutrition .
Pulmonary wise , he was maintained on a ventilator throughout the hospital course until the day of expiration .
Mr. [PER A  ] &apos;s neurologic condition was stable at the baseline exam as described above .
His family had a meeting with Dr. [PER Liftjesc  ] , Dr. [PER Telshey Vital  ] , and Dr. [PER Tineara Rhalt  ] of the Neurosurgical ICU .
This meeting took place on July 30th from 10:00 [PER AM  ] until approximately noon .
The family decided at this time that they wished to withdraw care from Mr. A .
They wished that he be extubated and that all medical treatment except for comfort measures be pursued .
Accordingly , the wishes of the family were attended to .
At approximately 1:45 PM on July 30th , his ventriculostomy tube was discontinued .
Shortly thereafter , his arterial line was removed .
Following this , at approximately 2:05 PM , his endotracheal tube was removed .
Mr. [PER A  ] immediately became bradycardic and desaturated .
At 2:10 PM on July 30th , he expired .
Mr. [PER A  ] , was immediately notified .
She refused an autopsy and agreed to donation of needed organ or tissue .
The [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] Admitting Desk was also notified as were Dr. [PER Liftjesc  ] , Dr. [PER Telshey Vital  ] , Dr. [PER Azel Hibbskays  ] , and the patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. [PER Tomedankell Flowayles  ] .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
EPIGLOTTITIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to [ORG Ez Ephtro Health Center  ] where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
Smoking none .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Oral cavity was normal .
Neck :
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
The right pyriform was narrowed by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
No masses .
Extremities :
Normal .
Back :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .
On 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
Tube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
O2 saturations looked good .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .
DISPOSITION :
On 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .

ADMISSION DATE :
3/23/95
DISCHARGE DATE :
04/04/95
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cholangiocarcinoma , recurrent ; status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1) Obstructive jaundice , secondary to recurrent tumor and / or stricture at the bile duct to jejunum anastomosis .
2) Subhepatic fluid collection , drained .
3) Clostridium difficile colitis with diarrhea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :
On 3/28/95 , replacement of permanent biliary stents and liver biopsy .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
On 3/24/95 , percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
On 3/27/95 , 3/28/95 , 3/30/95 , 3/31/95 , and 04/04/95 there were revisions and contrast injections to the biliary catheter drainage system .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 55-year-old man who is status post resection of a Klatskin tumor , who returns with persistent jaundice and right upper quadrant pain .
The present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in August of 1994 , and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation .
In September 1994 , he had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that shoed obstruction at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts .
In October 1994 , the Klatskin tumor was resected and it was shown to be moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma .
The surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
He was admitted in January 1994 , for biliary drainage catheter placement and balloon dilatation of what was thought to be an anastomotic stricture .
Biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
He presented now for evaluation of failed biliary drainage .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , he had a normal temperature and blood pressure .
His lungs were clear .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar .
The extremities were unremarkable .
Rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
His hematocrit was 25.8% , with a normal white blood cell count .
His bilirubin was total 11.1 , with a direct bilirubin of 10.2 and his alkaline phosphatase was 2,188 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan .
The computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement .
What then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on 3/28/95 , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
On 3/31/95 and 04/04/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
He was feeling much better , taking good diet and denying pain or fever .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
He was covered prophylactically for the indwelling stents with ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d.
On 04/04/95 , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. [PER Blinjesc  ] discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. [PER Ma  ] , in [LOC Taette  ] .
Dr. [PER Ma  ] will be working with Dr. [PER Besti Kotebreun  ] of [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] to manage the currently indwelling stents .
The patient will continue his course of Flagyl until that is finished and he will stay on the po ofloxacin until the external draining stents are removed .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE :
are Glyburide 5-15 mg po q a.m. and 0-10 mg po q p.m. , depending on amount of oral intake ; Celesone 1 1/2 tablets po q day , Tagamet 400 mg PO b.i.d. , ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d. , CZI sliding scale which will not be continued on discharge , and Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for a total of fourteen days .

SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Right therapeutic thoracentesis , 06/07/94 .
Brain MRI , 06/12/94 .
Placement of chest tube for bleomycin sclerotherapy , 06/20/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 68 year old female who presented to the emergency room on 05/22 with a chief complaint of increasing dyspnea .
She had a long history of significant and complex medical issues .
She had a long history of smoking and fairly severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
In addition , she had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a recent myocardial infarction in the November of 1994 .
On 02/20 she was admitted to [ORG Secla Berl Spo Hospital  ] with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and dyspnea .
She presented with wide complex tachycardia and congestive heart failure .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to [ORG Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital  ] on 02/21 .
Following her hospitalization at [ORG Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital  ] he was transferred to [ORG Louline Mauikings Medical Center  ] , where she had a protracted hospitalization during which she was treated for congestive heart failure , gastrointestinal bleeding , and uncontrolled atrial flutter rates .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , she was an elderly female in moderate respiratory distress , blood pressure 100/60 , respirations 26 , pulse 68 , temperature afebrile .
Her jugular venous pressure was within normal limits .
Arterial pulse contours were diminished bilaterally .
S1 and S2 were markedly diminished .
A soft systolic ejection murmur was audible at the base .
A soft Grade I-II / VI holosystolic murmur was evident at the apex .
No S3 was present .
Breath sounds were markedly diminished on the right ; crackles were present on the left , approximately 1/3 up .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds present and no pulsatile masses evident .
The lower extremity pulses were diminished .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
No grossly evident focal neurological findings were noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to [ORG Crestwall Hospital  ] , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A chest CT on 05/24 demonstrated a right lower lobe mass as well as significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy .
A cardiac ultrasound study on Memorial Day demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of .6 square cm .
Following an episode of mild rightsided weakness associated with slurring of speech on 06/06 , a brain MRI was obtained .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
In addition an old cerebellar focal infarct was noted , although metastasis could not be completely excluded .
Dr. [PER Margmimaui Jesclinke  ] was consulted and helped significantly with the day to day management of the patient &apos;s COPD and frequent desaturations in the setting of a large , recurrent right pleural effusion .
During the course of the last 4-5 days the patient &apos;s condition deteriorated substantially .
After extensive consultation with her family and with the patient herself , it was decided that her status should be made DNR .
This was completely consonant with her wishes and her family &apos;s wishes as well .
Over the weekend of 06/30 and 07/01 , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
She did not respond to intravenous diuretics or renal dose dopamine .
We insured that she was comfortable until she expired on 07/02/94 .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on 8-20-91 at which time a total knee repair was done to both the right and left knees .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to his room on postoperative day one .
The patient did , on , postoperative day one have a bout of grossly heme positive emesis .
He stated at this point that he did have a history of peptic ulcer disease and he did have a slow and continuous drop in his hematocrit until approximately postoperative day three .
The patient also had episodes of significant temperature spikes sometimes to 102.6 .
The patient was cultured multiple times , blood cultures , urine cultures and sputum cultures , all which were negative ( as well as chest x-ray ) .
The temperature spikes did continue but have reached to a degree no higher than 100 degrees Farenheit and occurred a significantly decreased number of times .
In terms of knee function , the patient has progressed very well and is ambulating approximately 12 feet on his own at this point .
In terms of followup care , I would suggest that the patient have a gastroenterologist consult upon completion of Rehab and for further workup of his grossly heme positive emesis , with possible guaiac positive stool searching for a source of a bleed .

THORACOABDOMINAL ANEURYSM .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
02/16/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
02/28/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
2/17/94 :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
HISTORY :
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the [ORG Eifro Medical Center  ] which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. [PER Riode Zetllille  ] for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
Since the patient &apos;s last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .
Extremities :
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
She has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
There were no intraoperative complications .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
She had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the [ORG On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center  ] .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Is satisfactory .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .
COMPLICATIONS :
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Lopressor 25 mg PO b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 PO q.a.m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 PO q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg PO q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg PO / PR q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , Benadryl 25-50 PO q.h.s. and Percocet 1-2 tablets PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. [PER Riode Zetllille  ] and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the [ORG Laelk Memorial Hospital  ] .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 111y year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on 05/01 complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of 12/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On 01/24 she was taken to the [ORG Rys Memorial Hospital  ] hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] and admitted there from 01/25 - 02/03 .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
On 05/05 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on 05/08 a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
1-26-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
02-02-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Ependymoma involving the conus medullaris of the spinal cord .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
January 26 , 1994 , intradural microsurgical exploration and biopsy of invasive intramedullary conus tumor .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient is to rest .
He was given prescriptions for Decadron with a Decadron taper and he was given an out patient appointment to see Dr. [PER Niste Addison  ] in the Radiation Medicine Service to begin out patient radiotherapy .
He was told to have his sutures removed in seven to ten days , and told to call the office if problems or questions arose .
He was also given a prescription for Percocet as needed for pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This twenty-six year old male was admitted to the [ORG Ph University Of Medical Center  ] on January 26 , 1994 to undergo surgical exploration of a conus tumor .
He had previously been evaluated for back pain and found to have a conus tumor on magnetic resonance imaging study .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Following the standard preoperative evaluation , he was taken to the operating room and underwent a laminectomy T11 , T12 , and L1 and intradural microsurgical exploration .
At the time of surgery we found an invasive conus tumor emanating from the ventral portio of the conus and completely engulfing and encircling all of the ventral nerve roots .
The procedure had been done with intraoperative monitoring , and every time we made an attempt to dissect tumor away from the nerve roots we achieved considerable stimulation of the lower extremity muscles .
We felt that the way the tumor was invading and wrapped around all of the nerves and sharing a common blood supply with them , that it would not be possible to achieve any form of significant surgical decompression or removal of tumor without leading to a substantial neurological deficit .
Therefore , the operation was terminated by placing a large dural graft to provide intradural room with the idea that postoperatively the lesion would be treated with radiation therapy .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The postoperative course was without complication .
Pain was managed initially with an intravenous patient controlled analgesia system .
The wound healed without difficulty and the drain was removed .
The patient began to ambulate .
His leg strength was noted to be identical to the way it had been prior to the surgery .
Because of his continued excellent progress , he was allowed to be discharged home on February 2 , 1994 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
(1) Hemoptysis .
(2) Metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone .
(3) Pancytopenia .
(4) Pain control .
(5) Chemotherapy-related dysuria .
(6) Chemotherapy-related tinnitus .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
[PER Shalyo Kaysplass  ] is a 36-year-old male , with metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , admitted with shortness of breath , hemoptysis , and hip pain .
Mr. [PER Kaysplass  ] &apos;s history is well-documented in previous discharge summaries .
Basically , he was diagnosed in 1994 with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone in his left hip , underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy , but was not a candidate for surgical resection and so underwent radiation therapy to the left hip .
He had metastases to the lungs , which responded to more chemotherapy and he underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation in January , 1996 .
For the past six weeks prior to admission , the patient was complaining of worsening right hip pain at the site of a bone marrow biopsy done to evaluate a new pancytopenia .
An magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a mass growing out of the right sacrum , which could have been tumor or a hematoma .
Approximately a week before admission , repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an enlarging soft tissue mass consistent with tumor .
Chest x-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules , which were thought , given the clinical situation , to be tumor .
The patient was set to undergo radiation therapy to the mass in the right hip when he called complaining of fatigue , dyspnea on exertion , and persistent hip pain .
He also complained of fever .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
[PER Shalyo Kaysplass  ] is an obese man in mild respiratory distress .
His oxygen saturation was 85% on room air .
His chest had diffuse rales .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm , although rapid .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient responded to oxygen , however , his pain in his hip was severe and required Morphine drip .
His hemoptysis did not improve and his platelet count was quite low .
Due to intermittent bouts of shortness of breath , and the understanding that he had a widely-metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , he was made a do not resuscitate , and on the fifth hospital day , the patient expired .

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
Recurrent malignant glioma .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Recurrent malignant glioma .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
(1) Doxepin , 75 mg. at bedtime ;
(2) Nystatin swish-and-swallow every four hours while awake ;
(3) Mycelex Troches three times a day ;
(4) Prednisone , 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. ;
(5) Cimetidine , 300 mg. at bedtime .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 40-year-old , right-handed , white male with a Grade III glioma of the cerebellum originally diagnosed in 07/96 .
He was treated at that time with subtotal resection followed by radiation to the lesion .
He had been maintained on low-dose steroid for most of the last 1 years because of increasing symptoms when the medication was tapered .
He was referred to Neuro Oncology Clinic on 11/28/96 with complaints of choking on liquids , increasing facial weakness and imbalance .
He also had reported progressive fatigue and weakness with an inability to arise from a sitting position without the use of his hands .
He had recently had a fall and had to crawl back to his vehicle because of an inability to right himself .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination in the office he was obviously cushingoid with a protuberant abdomen and cachectic arms and legs .
His neck was supple with no spinal tenderness .
There was a complete left seventh nerve palsy .
There was horizontal nystagmus on right and left gaze and some beats of vertical nystagmus when looking up or down .
There was 4/5 neck flexor , bilateral deltoid and iliopsoas weakness with wasting of the quadriceps musculature .
His distal strength was relatively preserved .
Sensation to touch was preserved .
There was normal appendicular coordination but obvious truncal ataxia with a widening of his base and an inability to tandem .
On general examination it was also noted that he had oral thrush as well as multiple subcutaneous firm but mobile nodules .
An MRI from 11/96 compared to his most recent MRI demonstrated residual enhancing mass near the roof of the left fourth ventricle as well as obvious ependymal enhancement in the frontal horns , body and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles .
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma with ependymal spread .
There was also great concern that he had developed cranial neuropathy and was choking and aspirating .
There was also obvious steroid toxicity .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was evaluated by the Speech Pathology Service who identified a mild dysarthria and oral dysphagia .
It was not felt that he was significantly aspirating and a modified barium swallow was not necessary .
He underwent a lumbar puncture on 11/29/96 which was traumatic , showing 58,000 red blood cells and increased protein .
An ample specimen was sent for cytological analysis .
He also was treated with Nystatin and Mycelex for his oral thrush and his Dexamethasone was changed to Prednisone in an effort to improve the weakness due to his steroid myopathy .
He was also given Lacri-Lube for the left eye as it was not fully closing due to his facial palsy .
The patient was discharged on 11/30/96 back to his home in [LOC Sastonton-mont , Ohio  ] .
He will be enrolled in an experimental chemotherapy protocol for recurrent malignant glioma .
The case will be discussed at Brain Tumor Conference on 12/03/96 .
He will also start a physical therapy program for the steroid myopathy once he is back in [LOC Sler  ] .

He had dopplerable lower extremity pulses on the left and on the right , they were palpable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted and taken to the Operating Room the next day on 12/24/09 where patient underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
In his post-operative course , patient was sent to the unit and was put on perioperative Vancomycin .
Post-operatively , patient was found to have frequent aberrant atrial premature beats and some rare ventricular premature beats .
His lungs were found to have decreased breath sounds with a question of fluid overload .
There was a question of whether to start him on Quinidine versus beta blockers .
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinetic and akinetic areas throughout the left and right ventricle .
Patient was loaded with Quinidine and then started on a maintenance dose .
Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm once on Quinidine .
Patient was discharged from the unit on 12/30/09 and was sent to the floor .
His digoxin was found to be elevated so his Digoxin was held for four days while levels slowly came down .
Patient was restarted on Digoxin just prior to discharge .
Patient also was found to have elevated LDH , alkaline phosphatase , and amylase prior to admission .
Lipase was within normal limits .
Ultrasound was obtained of the biliary tree which demonstrated no abnormalities .
Patient was also found to have several complaints of awaking in the middle of the night with tachypnea and some bilateral chest pain associated with breathing .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
This 88-year-old male with history of prostate CA was admitted from an outside hospital secondary to persistent hematuria status post nephrostomy tube placement transferred to [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] for further management .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. [PER Prehekote  ] is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .
He received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .
After that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .
The patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to [ORG Eifro Medical Center  ] because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .
He was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .
BUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .
Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .
Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .
Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .
However after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .
He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .
Due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from [ORG Eifro Medical Center  ] to the [ORG Retelk County Medical Center  ] for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .
The patient was transferred to [ORG Genearocktemp Ry Health  ] on March 3 , 1999 .

Liver and spleen were not palpable .
Bowel sounds normoactive .
Extremities :
Traced pitting edema .
No cyanosis and no clubbing .
Peripheral pulses were very strong and bounding .
No calf tenderness .
Homan &apos;s sign negative .
Neurologic :
Examination was limited because the patient speaks only Portuguese .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the patient &apos;s biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .
Liver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .
CBC :
WBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .
PT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .
No lung infiltrate .
CT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .
A mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .
The CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .
CK enzymes 146 .
Repeated three times and remained flat .
Troponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .
The specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .
Urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .
After admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .
He was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .
After transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .
The patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .
He continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .
During this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .
CPK was tracked , but was totally normal .
No beta blockers were given .
A long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .
Dr. [PER Lucreamull  ] discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. [PER Prehekote  ] could return home with hospice .
The patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. [PER Tomedankell Flowayles  ] will manage the hospice issues .
The patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
SEPSIS .
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
1 ) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED .
2 ) HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY .
3 ) END STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. [PER Vinktlandfreierm  ] was admitted from [ORG Owaleharbo Tanaminer Hospital  ] to which he had been discharged approximately four days prior to admission .
He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 .
He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload .
His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy .
He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d.
The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization .
During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic .
An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing .
He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy .
He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus .
In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25 , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 .
That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies .
He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties .
Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out .
He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth .
Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 .
Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 .
A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 .
Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first .
The family was called and came in to see the patient .
An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures .
The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
At 2:30 on June 26 , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired .
DISPOSITION :
The family was notified and came in to see the patient .
The family declined an autopsy saying that they felt that the patient had been through enough .
The patient &apos;s attending physician , Dr. [PER Erm Neidwierst  ] , was notified as well .

Mr. [PER Fyfeguayfalc  ] is an 87 year old white male with multiple medical problems including hypertension , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , Alzheimer &apos;s disease versus multi-infarct dementia , and akylosing spondylitis who was admitted on 04/05/93 to the Surgical Service with a chief complaint of bright red blood per rectum .
Barium Enema showed diverticula .
He was doing well on the Surgical Service until 04/08/93 when he experienced the acute onset of dyspnea and desaturation .
He was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He ruled in for myocardial infarction by EKG and enzyme criteria .
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit , his do not resuscitate status was clarified by his legal guardian .
It was Mr. [PER Fyfeguayfalc  ] &apos;s wish to not be resuscitated , no intubation , no pressors , and no defibrillation .
He was extubated on the evening of 04/08/93 and was transferred to [ORG Loui Dingspar Chepidster Medical Center  ] the morning of 04/09/93 .
At approximately 1:10 p.m. , he experienced the abrupt onset of increased dyspnea with O2 saturation in the seventies while eating lunch .
He became tachypneic and confused with labored breathing and a respiratory rate in the thirties .
He was placed on 100% non-rebreather with O2 saturation of 79% .
Blood pressure was 172/70 .
He was given one sublingual Nifedipine , a total of 4 mg of Morphine , and 20 mg of Lasix without significant result .
Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.19 , pCO2 74 , pO2 50 , and O2 saturation of 73% .
Chest X-Ray showed a right middle lobe infiltrate which was new , a left lower lobe infiltrate , and no edema .
Lungs had scattered rhonchi with little air movement .
He was suctioned with return of food particles , presumed aspiration .
His O2 saturation remained in the sixties to seventies despite repeated nebulizers and suctioning .
A decision was made to not bronchoscope the patient because of his do not resuscitate status .
He expired on 04/09/93 at 2:25 p.m.

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE BREAST .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
1. HYPONATREMIA , 1-13-94 .
2. PULMONARY EMBOLUS , 1-14-94 .
3. DIARRHEA , NAUSEA AND VOMITING , FEVER .
4. HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. [PER Berca Gachfrum  ] performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. [PER Wedleung  ] .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .
UTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .
Status post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .
She had menarche at age 15 .
She used the pill for five years in the past .

HEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .
Neck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear .
Chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .
Cardiovascular - Normal .
Abdomen - Normal .
There was no HSM .
Extremities - Her left arm was very swollen .
It was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .
There was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .
Neuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .
She also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .
Cranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .
Toes were downgoing .
LABORATORY DATA :
Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .
PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .
ALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .
Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .
UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .
Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .
So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .
Another major issue with this patient was pain control .
She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
That has been stable .
The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.
So that has really improved .
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Her INR is 2.3 .
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .
She is also a little dry .
The patient is on oxygen .
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
DISPOSITION :
Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Fair .
She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
She is to go to the [ORG Necsoncardel Medical Center  ] for more chronic care .
Follow-up is with Dr. [PER Wedleung  ] in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .
The appointment has already been made .
The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
dementia ? secondary to Alzheimer &apos;s disease ; benign prostatic hypertrophy .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
digoxin 0.25 milligrams po / daily ; proscar 5 milligrams po / daily ; cardura 1 milligram po / daily ; colace 100 milligrams po / daily ; sinemet 25/100 one PO t.i.d. times two days , then q.i.d. for the next three days , then five times daily until further orders ; ativan 1.0 milligrams po / qhs whenever necessary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. [PER Bath  ] is a 77-year-old retired psychologist who was admitted because of a fall .
He has a history of failing memory and difficulty with gait , dating back to 1993 when he had a cat scan which was said to be unremarkable , however , over the past year he has progressively deteriorated in terms of his memory and mental function and over the past six months has rapidly deterioratedwith his gait so that it has recently been very difficult for him to maintain his balance and walk unassisted .
Finally , he fell in his bath tub and was unable to get up .
A nursing assessment thought that it was unsafe for the patient to be at home so he was admitted to the hospital for evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
there was no evidence of serious trauma .
His general examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/80 ; pulse of 72 and regular .
He was in no acute distress .
His neck was supple .
The chest was normal .
The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs noted .
The carotids were normal .
There were no bruits .
There was some paravertebral tenderness over the lumbar sign but this was not severe .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and slightly distended but bowel sounds were present .
There were no masses noted .
The Extremities examination revealed no edema .
Pulses were palpable .
The neurological evaluation revealed that the patient spoke with slow speech with a paucity of expression and monotonal quality .
He was attentive and concentrate but did not perform serial addition or subtraction normally , although it was fair .
He was oriented as to the date and place and some historical details were maintained .
He was unable to ambulate without assistance .
His tone was cog wheeling in the upper extremities and there was a lead pipe type rigidity in the lower extremities .
There were also a few myoclonic jerks .
He also had some frontal lobe signs .
LABORATORY DATA :
upon admission included electrolytes which were normal .
BUN and creatinine were 17 and 1.0 ; digoxin level of .8 ; sugar of 154 ; white blood count of 7.4 ; platelet count of 180,000 ; hematocrit level of 35% .
The electrocardiogram demonstrated an old right bundle branch block , otherwise normal .
The head cat scan was negative .
The lumbar spine films showed an old L-9 compression fracture which was confirmed on cat scanning .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was evaluated by Dr. [PER Doll Grendbly  ] from the Neurology Service who thought that there was a good possibility that he had Parkinson &apos;s Disease with certainly some Parkinsonian features to his picture .
However , some of his features could be explained by normal pressure hydrocephalus although the normal head scan seemed to exclude that .
There was also a question of Alzheimer &apos;s Disease to explain his dementia .
Dr. [PER Block  ] recommended a trial of Sinemet therapy which was begun in the hospital and he was then transferred to are habilitation hospital for vigorous physical therapy and further evaluation of his Sinemet trial .
He will be followed closely in the out-patient department by both Dr. [PER Block  ] and his primary care physician , Dr. [PER Curling  ] .

Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Respiratory failure .
Congestive heart failure .
Right lower lobe pneumonia .
Atonic bladder with suprapubic catheter .
Anxiety .
Coronary artery disease .
History of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .
He was most recently discharged from [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to [ORG Linghs County Medical Center  ] from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .
The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .
The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .
The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .
The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .
On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .
The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .
He also denies any chest pain .
No orthopnea .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .
By the time the patient arrived at the [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .
His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .
The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .
The patient was not intubated .
However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .
A chest x-ray in the [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .
There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .
These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Associated medical problems include :
1. Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .
2. Anxiety .
3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .
4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Ativan 1 mg po twice a day .
2. Trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
3. Xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs .
4. Brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
5. Combivent 3 puffs four times per day .
6. Aerobid three puffs twice a day .
7. Sorbitol 30 cc every other day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress .
He had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 .
He was in moderate respiratory distress .
His temperature was 98F .
He had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam .
Neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses .
Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases .
There were no wheezes or rhonchi .
Heart exam revealed a soft S1 and S2 , no murmur was heard , no S3 .
Abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable .
Rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative .
Neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male .
He moved all extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 on 40% 02 .
Blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 .
Urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He stayed in the unit for about one day .
During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .
He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .
After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .
This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .
As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .
A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .
The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .
The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .
This was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .
The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .
The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .
It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .
The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .
While in the [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .
The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .
The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .
While in [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .
It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .
Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .
They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient &apos;s respiratory status was stable .
I think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had .
He needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for Physical Therapy to increase his muscle strength .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h .
2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day .
3. Ativan .5 mg twice a day .
4. Nasal oxygen 3L per minute .
5. Levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued until 4/12/99 .
6. Lasix 40 mg per day .
7. Prednisone 40 mg per day to be tapered over two weeks .
8. Xalatan eyedrops 1 gtt in left eye per day .
9. Alphagan 1 gtt in left eye three times a day .
10. Trusopt 1gtt in left eye three times a day .
11. Prilosec 20 mg per day .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient should have follow up with his primary care physician Dr. [PER Rod Linkeboltshieltrus  ] at the [ORG TRE 453  ] about one week after discharge from rehab facility .
The telephone number at his office is 236-4518 .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY

[PER KOTE , LYFRANKLAPALM  ]
UNIT NUMBER :
512-13-39
ADMISSION DATE :
01/18/2001
DISCHARGE DATE :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to Dr. [PER Riode Area  ] status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally .
The patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia .
He had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .
He also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .
He was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .
The patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of Dr. [PER Area  ] &apos;s office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .
He has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .
He had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the [ORG Alconspore Woocawo Medical Center  ] .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
His medications on admission include Coumadin and Levofloxacin .
His Coumadin has been held for two days .
His claudication is equal bilaterally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible .
His rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the [ORG Tocon Hospital  ] the previous week .
He has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .
His pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .
LABORATORY DATA :
His BUN and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count .
He has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. [PER Area  ] had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that I would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .
After discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .
EP to FE under general endotracheal anesthesia .
There was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .
Superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .
There was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .
The profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .
It was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .
The patient postoperatively did quite well .
He had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and Silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .
His groin incision was healing nicely and he was on Heparin , being converted to Coumadin .
Because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .
The orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to [ORG Frontera 34  ] to ensure that this would be performed properly .
No cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .
Despite loading him on Coumadin , his prothrombin time and INR increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of December .
I had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .
I explained to the patient that because of his early discharge I would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
acute renal insufficiency .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1983 , pulmonary hypertension , hepatitis C positive cirrhosis history with history of portal hypertension and status post an upper gastrointestinal bleed on 4-10-98 , who presents from [ORG Sondi Memorial  ] for work up of pulmonary infiltrates , acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension .
The patient presented to [ORG Sondi Memorial  ] on 4-10-98 with fatigue and fall , found to have a hematocrit of 29 , baseline 37 .
The patient was transfused two units and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done where it showed gastritis , candidal esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices .
A colonoscopy showed anteriordysplasia , no bleeding was seen .
The patient was discharged after one week on iron sulfate .
On 4-24 , the patient was seen again at [ORG Sondi Memorial  ] when he experienced at home a fall , no loss of consciousness , positive substernal chest pain , pleuritic pain , shortness of breath and cough .
He went to [ORG Sondi Memorial  ] where he ruled out for myocardial infarction and was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate / pneumonia , started on cefuroxime .
His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive chest physical therapy for possible blood , given Lasix for congestive heart failure , became hypotensive , hypoxic and intubated .
The patient was found to have expanding pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray , developed acute renal insufficiency with minimal urine output , less than 10 cc an hour , started on dopamine for hemodynamic instability .
An echocardiogram was obtained on 4-26 which showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal _____ left ventricular function , severe right ventricular dilatation with septal hypokinesis and flattening with a question of right ventricular apical clot raised with mild aortic stenosis , severe tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 70 millimeters , consistent with fairly severe pulmonary hypertension .
Blood cultures x two sent off with no growth .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with flat creatine kinases and he was sent to [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] for further work up .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
At the [ORG Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital  ] he was quite hypotensive , requiring dopamine at 1,000 , Levo at 12 .
His chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates on left lung with left upper lung patchy infiltrates and right hemidiaphragm elevated , consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome from possible pneumonia .
A urinalysis was obtained which showed blood , urine sediment was active with positive dysmorphic cells , red cell casts , and 1+ albumin with mild protein uria .
The patient had ANCA , anti-GBM , anti-streptolycin , ANA , UPEP , SPEP , renal ultrasound , hepatitis C cryoglobulin sent out .
He had a bronchoscopy immediately done which showed no fresh blood , just old clot and a pulmonary arterial line placed in the right internal jugular vein .
Question of pulmonary-renal syndrome was raised .
The patient subsequently deteriorated over time , was started on CVVH and suffered significant complications without improvement of his pulmonary / renal situation .
A family meeting was held on 5-2-98 and it was decided that the patient should be made comfort care only .
All CVVH and the ventilator was removed and the patient spontaneously passed away on 5-2-98 , at 4:55 p.m.
Family and primary carephysician informed .

PT 13.5 , PTT29 , platelet count 165 , electrolytes notable only for a potassium of 4.8 , amylase of 73 , bilirubin of total 5 , direct 4.4 , SGOT of 88 , alk phos of 458 , EKG is normal sinus rhythm .
Chest xray shows bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right .
CT scan of the abdomen revealed adensity in the portal vein as well as an abnormal area in the liver , consistent with possible infarct , although abscess and malignancy cannot be ruled out .
HOSPITAL COURSE ;
The patient was admitted and taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring .
He received approximately four units of blood transfusion and then maintained a hematocrit of greater than 25 .
The GI radiology service was consulted and on the morning after admission a TIPS procedure was performed .
At that time , the patient was noted to have a preprocedure gradient of 24 , a post procedure gradient of 9 to 11 .
He is noted to have a large left gastric varus which was embolized .
He had a nonocclusive thrombus in the right and left branches of the portal vein , however , the main portal vein , splenic vein , SMV , IMV were all patent .
He had a large recannalized umbilical vein and was dilated to 12 mm in diameter .
Post procedure , the patient did exceptionally well , he never had any sign of recurrent GI bleeds .
He was transferred to the floor in stable condition .
On 12/21/95 he was taken to the operating room at which time an EDG was performed which showed several smaller esophageal varices with two larger varices at the gastroesophageal junction .
There was no evidence of gastric varices .
These two varices were banded without difficulty .
Postoperatively the patient did quite well , he was kept NPO for 24 hours and then gradually started on clear liquids .
He is tolerating a soft solid diet upon discharge .
His discharge hematocrit is approximately 25.8 .
He has been restarted on his regimen of diuretics including Aldactone and Lasix .
The patient was noted to be fairly hypotensive throughout his hospitalization despite aggressive fluid resuscitation .
This is believed to be secondary to his Inderal dose .
Subsequently his beta blocker dose was decreased to 5 mg po qid and his discharge blood pressure is approximately 95/45 .
Additionally his potassium dose was decreased to 20 qd for his admission potassium of 4.8 .
He is continued on his Ofloxacin prophylaxis for SBP throughout his hospitalization and will be discharged home on this as well .
Notably while the patient has a small pleural effusion , he does not have any evidence of ascites at this time .
The patient continues to be a candidate for possible liver transplant and his evaluation for placement on the transplant list is still in progress .
The patient is awaiting a final evaluation from Dr. [PER Sintnieves  ] of the Addiction Services Team .
He was in Dr. [PER Sintnieves  ] &apos;s office at the time of his hematemesis on the day of admission and was seen again by Dr. [PER Sintnieves  ] while hospitalized .
He has been told to follow up with Dr. [PER Sintnieves  ] again after discharge .
Again , the patient is quite adamant that he wished to pursue liver transplant and will follow through with all physician recommendations as needed to insure his candidacy .
Notably , the patient did not develop any encephalopathic signs post TIPS procedure , however he was started on Lactulose to prevent any mild mental status changes .

His mental status changes remained stable from their perioperative baseline and he was continued on his Haldol .
He was in atrial fibrillation postoperatively but his rate was well controlled on digoxin and Lopressor .
His chest tubes were all removed by postoperative day 3 .
He was placed on Coumadin given the presence of the persistent atrial fibrillation and it is thought that he would only need short term anticoagulation for approximately 3 months .
By postoperative day 7 the patient was stable enough for discharge to home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient will follow up at the anti-coagulation clinic for his Coumadin follow up .
He will follow up with Dr. [PER Rhalt  ] and Dr. [PER Em  ] .
He will be visited by home [ORG Sini Memorial Hospital  ] services .
His medications on discharge include digoxin 0.375 mg PO QD , Lopressor 75 mg PO BID , Coumadin to attain an INR of 1.8 to 2 , Haldol 0.5 mg Po BID and Prednisolone 0.12% OU QD .

Sclerae anicteric .
Symmetric face .
Neck :
bilateral bruits , very diminished right carotid pulse if any , and a brisk left carotid pulse .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with median sternotomy scar .
Heart regular rate and rhythm without a murmur .
The abdomen is soft without bruit .
Multiple midline scars .
No organomegaly .
GU :
Normal female .
Rectal guaiac negative .
Multiple external hemorrhoids .
Normal tone .
Nomasses .
Pulses are :
radial-left trace , right 2+ ; brachial-left 1+ , right 2+ ; femoral 2+ bilaterally ; popliteal 2+ bilaterally ; dorsalispedis 2+ bilaterally ; posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally .
ASSESSMENT :
Complicated patient who has continued smoking for her extensive peripheral vascular disease history .
She now has possibly quit cigarettes , but has renewed symptoms of right carotid disease .
She is to undergo an angiogram when her coagulation profile allows .
She has been on Coumadin .
We will check her coags before heparinizing , and she will go to angiography when her prothrombin time comes within an acceptable range .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was seen by Dr. [PER Tomedankell Flowayles  ] of Cardiology who recommended that , if she were to undergo an operative procedure , that she first have a coronary perfusion scan .
The patient was also seen by Dr. [PER Breutz  ] of the GI Service who assessed her as not needing colonoscopy or a GI series at this time .
She was also seen by the Stroke Service who noted that a recent magnetic resonance angiogram had reportedly shown a right common carotid artery occlusion .
They also noted that a careful elicitation of her visual symptoms seemed possibly consistent more with migraine than with ischemia .
They recommended that she have a baseline head computerized tomographyscan , agreed with obtaining an angiogram and recommended trying a trial of migraine therapy to see if ocular symptoms resolved .
Meanwhile the patient was heparinized .
Her prothrombin time came down and , on 11/15/96 , she underwent angiography .
This showed :
1. a patent aorto innominate left common carotid graft .
2. an occluded right common carotid artery , right internal carotid and reconstitution of a short segment of right external carotid from the left vertebral .
3. a mild stenosis of the right proximal subclavian artery .
4. mild stenosis of the right vertebral origin .
5. apatent left common carotid , left internal carotid , status post left carotid endarterectomy .
6. an occluded left external carotid .
7. a patent left subclavian proximally , occluded left axillary artery with reconstitution ofthe left brachial artery .
8. moderate to severe stenosis of the left vertebral origin .
9. right cerebral hemisphere fills from the left vertebral and the left internal carotid .
Given these angiographic findings , which were not amenable to surgery , the patient was weaned from heparin , restarted on Coumadin , and was discharged today , 11/18/96 , with therapeutic protime .
In retrospect , her symptoms may have been surrounding the final thrombosis of her right carotid .
A perfusion scan was not necessary as no surgical procedure was entertained .
An I-head computerized tomography scan done on 11/16/96 showed two areas of old infarction without evidence of a recent infarct or bleed .
Both the old infarcts were in the right hemisphere , # 1 in the frontal lobe nad # 2 around the centrum semi ovale .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient was discharged home in good condition .
FOLLOW UP :
She will follow up with her local doctor &apos;s Coumadin clinic .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Cellulitis and thrombocytopenia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 52-year-old woman who was diagnosed with metastatic high-grade leiomyosarcoma in 1995 and had undergone extensive treatments including multiple laser chemotherapy , pulmonary wedge resections , and brain surgeries .
She had recently completed a cycle of gemcitabine and Taxotere .
Her primary oncologist felt that she was end-stage , but the patient and her family were questioning for additional treatment .
She was seen at [ORG Carmoaksfearwhit Hospital  ] for regular follow up to check her cell counts .
She was found at that time to have possible cellulitis and was admitted for this as well as out of concern that she had had many falls at home and did not have services .
The patient reported noticing redness on her left hand incidentally the morning of admission and denied any fevers or cuts .
The hand was nontender .
Her most recent fall was the day prior to admission , and she did not hit her head .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
In 1992 , she had left calf leiomyosarcoma resection with radiation .
In 1995 , she had pulmonary metastasis and received chemotherapy and wedge resections .
She also had metastasis of her liver , lungs , and pancreas .
In 1999 , she had central nervous system evolvement with left parietal mass resection .
In 2003 , her left lower lobe lung mass progressed , and she was deemed not to be a surgical candidate .
She also had a history of deep venous thrombosis , reflex sympathetic dystrophy , PCP pneumonia , cesarean section 1999 , and history of uveitis .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is a psychologist and lived with her husband , had 3 children , lived in [LOC Washington  ] , no tobacco , no alcohol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
The mother with breast cancer .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
General :
A chronically ill-appearing , pale woman with mild dyspnea , speaking in full sentences .
Oropharynx is without petechiae or evidence of bleeding .
She did have mild thrush , no exudate , no lymphadenopathy .
Cardiovascular Exam :
Regular rate and rhythm , 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left upper sternal base without aeration .
Lung exam revealed diffuse breast sounds over the left lower lobe as well as left upper lobe .
Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds , soft , no hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities were warm and well perfused with 2+ distal pulses .
There was 2+ , nonpitting edema in the left foot .
Back revealed no spinal tenderness .
Skin on her right hand showed multiple confluent ecchymosis , right foot also revealed ecchymosis .
LABS ON ADMISSION :
White blood count 5.8 , hematocrit 22.2 , platelets 11 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 97 , bicarb 42 , BUN 17 , creatinine 0.6 , glucose 126 , alk phos 310 , calcium 8.4 , albumin 3.1 , and INR 1.2 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for possible cellulitis of the right hand .
She was initially given Ancef IV .
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the second day of her admission due to hypercarbic respiratory distress .
Her blood gas at that time was PH 7.26 , bicarb 93 , oxygen 70 , chest x-ray was felt to be consistent with fluid overload .
There was also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate and effusion .
She was also covered with levofloxacin empirically for pneumonia .
She was started on nasal BiPAP and repeat arterial blood gas on the BiPAP was PH 7.26 , PCO2 1.11 , and PO2 157 .
Her code status was visited with her family .
They felt the cause of her dyspnea was potentially reversible , and that she would want aggressive management at that time .
1. Respiratory :
The patient was intubated with goal of decreasing her PCO2 .
This was accomplished and her arterial blood gas improved PH 7.49 , PCO2 58 , and PO2 242 .
She had abronchoscopy on 09/18/2004 which revealed a left lower lobe basal segment tumor versus mucous plug versus edematous versus foreign body aspiration .
The patient self-extubated on 09/20/2004 and was maintained on intermittent noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until the time of her death .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient required neosynephrine throughout her intensive care unit stay .
This was continued until 09/24/2004 at which time her family decided to withdraw pressers .
3. Comfort :
The patient was agitated and uncomfortable throughout much of her intensive care unit stay .
It was difficult to both keep her comfortable and maintain adequate respiratory drive .
Her pulmonary status gradually worsened throughout her intensive care stay after her self-extubation on 09/20/2004 .
Reintubation was not desired by the patient or the family .
Her code status was DNR .
She developed rattling in her trachea audible without a stethoscope on 09/24/2004 , was poorly arousable , and had a venous PCO2 of 103 .
She was more awake that afternoon , was able to interact somewhat with her family .
However , in light of her suffering and terminal condition , her family elected to discontinue the use of neosynephrine .
The patient died on 09/25/2004 at 12:49 a.m.
Death was pronounced by Dr. [PER Ilon Cale  ] .
The family was offered and declined a postmortem examination .
Prior to her death , she had been comfortable on the Morphine drip .

647-26-75
ADMISSION DATE :
03/16/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
04/02/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Esophageal bleed .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Hepatocellular carcinoma , diabetes mellitus , cirrhosis , hepatitis C .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73 year old man with a history of hepatitis C , cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma and diabetes mellitus who was in his usual state of health until 2 days prior to admission when he had an episode of hematemesis x 1 .
He discussed this with his friend at [ORG Sloan-caer/viewbonse Memorial Hospital  ] but did not seek medical attention , hoping it would go away .
On the morning of admission , Mr. [PER Kote  ] awoke from sleep and immediately vomited a large quantity of blood .
He said it was large in quantity .
He had associated right upper quadrant pain and shortly thereafter passed a large black stool .
Paramedics were called and found him to have a blood pressure of 120/80 , a pulse of 92 , breathing at 16 and normally cognizant .
During transport to the [ORG Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital  ] Emergency Room , he vomited an additional 200 cc. of dark , red blood .
In the emergency department , an NG-tube was placed and additional dark blood was suctioned .
He subsequently was lavaged to clear but had a repeat of hematemesis prompting urgent endoscopy .
On endoscopy , he was found to have Grade III varices without active bleeding in the lower one-third of the esophagus that had &quot; stigmata of bleeding and red signs . &quot;
He had additional varices in a hiatal hernia .
In total , five bands were placed .
Gastric varices were also found and there was blood in the body of the stomach .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout with blood pressures in the 150 &apos;s and heart rate in the 90 &apos;s .
There were no orthostatics , unfortunately , done .
The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis C several years ago .
He has had blood transfusions in the past but denies all intravenous drug abuse .
He has a history of alcoholism that dates back approximately 60 years , but ended 7 years ago .
He says that during the period of his alcoholism he drank &quot; As much as I could . &quot;
In May of 1998 , Mr. [PER Kote  ] underwent evaluation for expanding abdominal girth , nausea and vomiting .
A CT scan of the abdomen at that time revealed multiple lesions on the liver .
On needle biopsy , these lesions were found to be hepatocellular carcinoma .
His AFB at that time was 251 .
He did not undergo curative or palliative treatment at that time .
He is not a candidate for liver transplant because of his age .
At that time , he was started on Lasix and Aldactone .
Until 2 months ago , the patient had done remarkably well until he noticed an increasing abdominal girth .
He was evaluated by his primary care physician who found that he had gained 15 pounds and referred him to Dr. [PER Lierm  ] at [ORG Rose-tedmargpark Medical Center  ] for diagnosis and therapeutic paracentesis , which he underwent on March 12 , 1998 .
Approximately 2 liters of clear ascitic fluid were drained at that time .
Cell counts were negative for SBP and cultures have been negative to date .
He had not had and continues not to have any episodes of fever .
He complains of right upper quadrant pain that began shortly after his paracentesis 4 days ago .
He has not had any anorexia and continues to take his outpatient medications .
He had not drank any alcohol for the past 7 years .

His EKG had normal axis , normal intervals , no LVH or RVH , tiny Q &apos;s in V3 through V6 , no T wave inversions or other indications of acute ischemia .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Our impression was this was a 73 year old man with cirrhosis , portal hypertension , hepatocellular carcinoma , hepatitis C , history of alcoholism in the past , history of peptic ulcer disease on aspirin without acid blockade who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple esophageal and gastric varices .
His portal hypertension resulting in a ruptured varices was almost certainly his cause of bleed .
There was no evidence of ulcers on endoscopy .
His bleed also might have been precipitated by med non-compliance versus other causes of increased blood pressure such as increased salt intake .
The temporal proximity to paracentesis was initially worrisome for an underlying infection without precipitating hemodynamic imbalance , although no evidence of infection was established with any sputum , paracentesis culture or blood culture .
Given the extent of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis of cancer , the risk of worsening obstruction to portal venous flow versus ____________ was also increased .
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit while his initial care that first night was , by system :
Neurologically , given the risk of hepatic encephalopathy with the recent GI bleed , he was put on lactulose 30 cc. PO titrated to 4 loose stools per day .
Cardiovascularly , he was hypertensive by report on admission and TNG drip , Lasix , Aldactone and propranolol was instigated to keep his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 .
Rhythm wise , he was in normal sinus rhythm , no issues .
His PR interval was watched as propranolol was started .
There was no evidence of ischemia .
Pulmonary wise , he had some wheezing on exam .
He was treated with inhalers .
There was a suggestion of pneumonia on exam , but not on chest x-ray .
GI wise , he underwent status post banding x 5 for bleeding esophageal varices .
He was kept NPO .
He was started originally on propranolol and then switched to metoprolol as he experienced some wheezing in order to decrease his portal pressure .
He was also started on triatide , omeprazole .
In terms of Hem wise , he had experienced an approximately 12 point crit drop with this bleed .
For this , he was given 6 units of FFP , 4 units of packed red blood cells and platelets were kept greater than 60 with transfusion of platelets .
He was also given Vitamin K 10 mg. PO x 3 days .
He was treated with Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis .
He was kept in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours during which time , his hematocrit remained stable and he had no other signs of continued GI bleed .
At that point , he was transferred to [ORG Carespistown Hospital  ] for further management .
On his second day of admission , there was a concern about a developing pneumonia based on a worsening lung exam and also worsening cough , although sputum and all blood cultures remained negative for pathogens and the patient did not have a temperature spike .
Despite this , he was started on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD on March 18th as well as Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID for the possibility of an emerging aspiration pneumonia .
The major therapeutic concern on the floor was diuresis .
His Aldactone was gradually titrated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. per day divided in three even doses .
In addition , Lasix was added on to help him with diuresis .
Between March 20th and March 25th , he lost approximately 7 pounds on this regimen .
However , after Lasix was added back on , his creatinine rose from approximately 1.4 up to 1.7 and Lasix was held for 24 hours .
At that time , a dose of 20 mg. IV BID was re-instigated .
On the 400 mg. of Aldactone , his potassium remained in the high normal range around 5.0 .
Therefore , on March 25th , his Aldactone was decreased to 100 mg. PO TID and Lasix was kept at 20 mg. BID .
On this regimen , his weight remained approximately stable .
He was also kept on a low salt diet .
He was also kept on a 2 liter per day fluid restriction .
By March 26 , 1998 , he was ready to discharged back to [ORG Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center  ] , although he would stay in the Medical Unit there before returning back to his own room .
At discharge , the active issues still to be dealt with at [ORG Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center  ] are :
1. Necessity of daily electrolytes and creatinine monitoring as his diuretic regimen was optimized .
At discharge , he was on 100 mg. Aldactone TID and 20 mg. of Lasix BID but with potassium running in the high normal range necessitating daily electrolyte checks while the exact ratio of Lasix to Aldactone was optimized .
2. He also needs daily weight checks and daily abdominal exam to evaluate his fluid status .
3. He also needs TID fingerstick glucose to monitor his blood sugar .
4. In terms of his antibiotics , he has 4 days left of his Flagyl 500 mg. q8hours .
For SBP prophylaxis , he should be left indefinitely on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .
5. He should be enforced on a no concentrated sugars , low salt diet .
6. He also should have a 2 liter fluid restriction , if possible .
7. He should have initially twice a week checks of his hematocrit to make sure that his GI bleeding has stabilized .
FOLLOW UP :
1. He will follow up with his primary care physician , Dr. [PER Portal  ] , at [ORG Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center  ] .
Doctor [PER Portal  ] has been notified of the patient &apos;s progress at [ORG Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital  ] .
2. From our GI Service , the patient will follow up with Dr. [PER Shufftakeaakote  ] and follow up will be arranged in GI Clinic for next week .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Prilosec 20 mg. PO BID .
2. Zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO QD .
3. Isordil 10 mg. PO TID .
4. Lopressor 12.5 mg. PO BID .
5. Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .
6. Atrovent nebs q8hours .
7. Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID to stop on 3/31/1998 .
8. Albuterol q4hour nebulizer treatments .
9. Lactulose 30 cc. PO BID .
10. Aldactone 100 mg. PO TID titrated to potassium .
11. Lasix 20 mg. PO BID .
12. NPH Insulin 14 units subq in the morning , 10 units subq in the evening as well as additional CZI Insulin based on TID fingersticks .
ADDENDUM :
Unfortunately patient could not be discharged on 3/28/98 because , in the context of starting his Lasix , his creatinine bumped overnight from 1.7 to 2.2 , possibly because of a progression of his hepatorenal syndrome .
His potassium also climbed to 5.1 .
Because of this , we held all of his diuretics , namely his Lasix and Aldactone .
Despite holding his Aldactone , his potassium continued to rise over the course of the next two days .
It went as high as 5.8 on 3/29/98 .
He was treated with Kayexalate b.i.d. 30 gm. as treatment for this .
By 3/31/98 his potassium had gone down to 4.0 .
We then restarted a much smaller dose of Aldactoneat 50 mg. PO Q day .
This was the dose of Aldactone he had originally been admitted with .
On 3/31/98 the junior resident on [ORG Drugway Hospital  ] , Dr. [PER Asaleysean Portal  ] , had an extensive conversation with the patient about his future medical care .
Patient was very clear that he did not want any extraordinary measures done in case of acute illness .
Specifically he did not want to be intubated or have any of the ACLS protocol in the case of acardiac or pulmonary arrest .
He also was very adamant that if he was to rapidly GI bleed , as from an esophageal bleed , that he did not want any extraordinary measures taken .
Specifically he did not want to be re-banded .
We also addressed the possibility of having the GI service re-endoscope him in a few weeks to look at the progression of his esophageal banding .
He said that he did not feel that that made any sense given his other comorbid disease .
The patient was very adamant that in the future he would prefer to stay at the [ORG Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital  ] where he is in residence .
Dr. [PER Asaleysean Portal  ] spoke with Dr. [PER Fat  ] of the [ORG Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center  ] about this and that residence will make it clear that patient is not to be transferred back to an acute care facility in the case of decompensation .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
lactulose 30 cc &apos;s PO b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg. PO b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO Q day , Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d. , Metoprolol 12.5 mg. PO b.i.d. , Levofloxacin 250 mg. PO Q day , Atrovent nebs Q8 hours , Albuterol nebs Q8 hours , and Flagyl 500 mg. IV Q8 hours with the last day 4/1/98 .
Patient will need no further antibiotics in his nursing home .
He was also on Aldactone 50 mg. PO Q day .
We decided to discontinue his Lasixas this had resulted in increase in his creatinine .
At the [ORG Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital  ] he will need daily weights as well as daily lytes , specifically potassium , BUN and creatinine to make sure that he can safely tolerate this dose of Aldactone .
He should also have a low salt , low potassium diet without concentrated sweets and 2 liter fluid restriction .
He will also need t.i.d. fingerstick glucose and he will follow up with Dr. [PER Fat  ] at [ORG Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital  ] .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a seventy two year old female with multiple cardiac risk factors and Barrett &apos;s esophagitis who was discharged from [ORG Daughtersvillshamen&apos;s Hospital  ] on Jun 28 , 1999 after admission for chest pain of uncertain etiology , but an exercise tolerance test with Adenosine MIBI showed a mild reversible perfusion defect posterolaterally .
The patient &apos;s medication regimen was augmented .
See details in discharge summary of Jun 26 , to Jun 28 , 1999 .
On Jun 29 , 1999 the patient had her typical tingling across the chest with left arm pain several hours after cleaning house and going out to lunch .
On Jun 30th , the following morning , she wakened with her symptoms , but they progressed to substernal chest pain and nausea .
Nitroglycerin sublingual x three failed to relieve symptoms and she was referred to the nearest emergency room , which was at [ORG Lu Son Medical Center  ] hospital .
There her Electrocardiogram was interpreted as showing inferolateral changes .
She was transferred to [ORG Daughtersvillshamen&apos;s Hospital  ] for cardiac catheterization .
On review of her Electrocardiogram here there did not appear to be a significant changes .
Specifically , the T wave inversion in F was more distinct than on previous Electrocardiogram here , but was in the direction of the R-wave vector .
Other changes were consistent with lead placement .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY / FAMILY HISTORY / SOCIAL HISTORY :
See discharge summary of Jun 26 to Jun 28 , 1999 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Pindolol 10 milligrams po b.i.d. , Transderm nitro .1 milligrams / hour .
Aspirin ( on hold pending repeat EGD ) , Lipitor 20 milligrams po q p.m. , nitroglycerin sublingual PRN , Premarin .9 milligrams a day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. for seven days .
ALLERGIES :
Ampicillin associated with hives , Detrol may have caused fluid retention , calcium channel blockers avoided because of [PER Barrett  ] &apos;s esophagitis .
SBE prophylaxis for mild MR an AI .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 152/50 , heart rate 80 , respirations 15 , temperature 97.7 , carotids II+ without bruits , no jugular venous distention , lungs clear , core regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Extremity pulses all intact , 1+ ankle edema .
Neurologic intact .
LABORATORY :
Sodium 134 , potassium 4.3 , Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm with normal intervals , non-specific T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Impression was of a chest pain again with typical and atypical features in a patient with coronary artery disease documented by stress test with MIBI , multiple cardiac risk factors and [PER Barrett  ] &apos;s esophagitis .
Dr. Barrett was consulted for an opinion in fact whether it was warranted to proceed with cardiac catheterization given the overall picture as well as the patient &apos;s reluctance due to her sister &apos;s recently having had an acute myocardial infarction while undergoing cardiac catheterization .
On Barrett &apos;s recommendation , cardiac catheterization was performed .
Angiogram showed entirely clear coronary arteries with a right dominant system .
It was concluded that the patient &apos;s chest pain was esophageal in origin . ( Interestingly , her sister who had the myocardial infarction during cardiac catheterization also had an angiogram showing clear coronaries according to the patient ) .
The patient was still awaiting her esophagogastroduodenoscopy with Dr. [PER Gootzfrier  ] .
Results were discussed with the patient and her ongoing therapy reviewed .
In view of the catheterization results , the patient opted to discontinue her Lipitor for now .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Chest pain with reversible defect on recent exercise tolerance test Adenosine MIBI and normal coronary angiography .
Other diagnoses as in past medical history ( see discharge summary of 6/26 to 6/28/99 ) .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Pindolol 10 milligrams po b.i.d. , Premarin .9 milligrams po q d , Prilosec 20 milligrams po b.i.d. ( increased for possible esophageal of chest pain ) .
Discontinued nitroglycerin , Aspirin and Lipitor .

The patient was re-staged during his admission with a urine and serum electroimmunophoresis and a full skeletal survey .
He also received a four-day Decadron burst .
The patient had pain in the L3 distribution .
His MRI of the spine showed no clear reason for the pain and thus , a pelvic CT was obtained showing a large right pelvic mass that likely was causing his leg pain .
Radiation oncology was scheduled for next Tuesday to irradiate the mass .
Urinary retention .
Although there was a T5 compression fracture compressing the cord without signal change , there was no evidence that this lesion could be causing his urinary retention ; and it was felt that the pelvic mass more likely accounted for his urinary retention .
Fevers .
His blood and urine cultures were obtained and remained negative throughout admission .
His chest X-ray did not reveal source of his fevers .
The patient was placed on Levaquin .
Shortness of breath .
The patient had a V-Q scan on admission that was low probability for PE .

DISCHARGE DATE :
08/28/2000
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 67 year old male presenting with new onset of fevers and jaundice x one day .
He was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when he first noted diffuse abdominal pain exacerbated by defecation and accompanied by diaphoresis .
Temperature of 102.7 was measured at home .
He noted the onset of jaundice one day prior to admission , and then visited his primary care provider , Dr. [PER Vas  ] of [LOC Grandhdale  ] who referred him to [ORG Daughtersvillshamen&apos;s Hospital  ] for admission .
The patient also noted the onset of diarrhea 3-4 times a day of yellow color without presence of blood .
He had not eaten any raw foods or other likely causes of infectious gastroenteritis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant only for hypertension .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient has mild fever of 100.0 upon admission , otherwise stable .
Patient was markedly jaundiced on admission with very mild right upper quadrant tenderness to firm palpation and no noted lymphadenopathy .
Neurologic exam was benign and nonfocal .
Of note , the patient &apos;s platelets were noted to be 91 with an alanine-aminotransferase of 64 and an aspartate-aminotransferase of 85 .
Amylase and lipase were both elevated with amylase of 193 and lipase of 55.6.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound showed possibility of gallstones without ascites .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted , diet was cautiously advanced .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan was obtained and GI was consulted who recommended observation .
The following day , the patient &apos;s fevers had resolved and the jaundice was additionally resolving .
Symptoms were felt to be attributable to possible past gallstone causing a brief episode of pancreatitis .
ERCP was performed by Gastroenterology on the 27th , which showed no stones and normal cystic duct and normal gallbladder .
Sphincterotomy was performed ; no evidence of biliary disease was observed .
The patient was discharged on 08/28/00 in stable condition .
