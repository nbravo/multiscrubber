1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. HISTORY OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE WITH FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA.
5. HISTORY OF DEPRESSION.

TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease ,
CRF , and history of flash pulmonary edema , recently admitted to
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">HWGDSZ</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/14/12</PHI> after sudden onset of shortness of breath
unrelieved by one sublingual nitroglycerin. This shortness of
breath awakened her from sleep. Her blood pressure in the
Emergency Room was 230/110 without EKG changes. She responded well
to IV Lasix and IV nitroglycerin , saturating at 99% on 100%
nonrebreather mask. Chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema. Her blood pressure was stabilized on IV nitroglycerin with
resolution of her shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction. The patient was also recently admitted one
month ago to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">I.O.*Hewitt Clinic</PHI> for flash pulmonary edema without
evidence of myocardial infarction. Echo on admission showed 30%
ejection fraction with anteroapical and posterobasal hypokinesis.
Cardiac catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1997 showed a 90% proximal RCA
lesion and diffuse distal LAD disease. During vigorous rehydration
following that cardiac catheterization , she developed recurrent
pulmonary edema requiring intubation from which she was weaned
following diuresis. Because her pulmonary edema was believed to be
ischemia related , she was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for RCA angioplasty. On this admission , she denies any
chest pain , shortness of breath , or dizziness. She has three
pillow orthopnea , ankle edema. She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea with the exception of her current presentation. The
patient's coronary risk factors include diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , post menopausal status without
hormone replacement therapy , and history of tobacco use. Her
exercise tolerance is such that she develops shortness of breath
with walking one block or one flight of stairs. She reports having
to sit down at every other bench in the mall.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypercholesterolemia. Total cholesterol
266 down to 193. 2. Hypertension. 3.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy seven years ago and
status post five years of Tamoxifen therapy. She has had no other
chemo or radiation treatment. 4. Depression. 5. Hypercalcemia ( no
alkalized syndrome ) <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/11.</PHI> 6. History of recurrent pneumonia. 7.
History of diverticulitis. 8. Glaucoma. 9. Non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus diagnosed one year ago , diet controlled. 10.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a history of pyelonephritis at age
three. 11. Mitral regurgitation. 12. Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 40 , hormone
replacement therapy for five years which was then discontinued
secondary to her breast cancer. 13. Status post bilateral knee
replacement.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. started three
weeks ago , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Isordil 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , Timoptic
0.25% one GTT OU b.i.d. , Serax 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia ,
and IV heparin at 1 , 300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: Tagamet causes a rash and adhesive tape.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for a history of tobacco. She quit 17
years ago. She uses no alcohol and no IV drug
use. She lives with her husband in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</PHI> and has six children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of stomach cancer. Mother , two
aunts , and sister have history of myocardial
infarction at ages greater than 60.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has been following her weight since
her last discharge ( pulmonary edema ). She
reports a weight loss from 177 to 175 lb over the last couple of
days. She reports a 12 lb weight loss in the last month. She has
no complaints of dysuria or cough.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant female , resting
comfortably in bed. Her temperature was
98.5 , blood pressure 156/68 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , and 95% on
two liters. There was no JVD. Carotids were 1+ without bruits , no
thyromegaly , and no lymphadenopathy. Lungs revealed right basilar
crackles. She was using accessory muscles for respirations. Heart
revealed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2. There was a
II-III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the LSB. There was a III/VI
holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. There was
no S3 or S4. Her abdomen was slightly distended with no
hepatosplenomegaly. She was guaiac negative. She had 2+ femoral
pulses bilaterally without bruits and 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
There was no ankle edema. Neurological examination was grossly
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN was 59 , creatinine 3.9 , hematocrit 28.9 , and
MCV 82.3. Magnesium was 2.4. Chest x-ray from
outside hospital was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG revealed
normal sinus rhythm at 81 , normal axis and intervals ( QT slightly
increased at 0.46 ) , LVH , LAE. There was T flattening in AVL.
There were no acute ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient was much improved after
successful diuresis with improvement
of her pulmonary examination and no evidence of right sided
failure. She was saturating well on room air. Care was taken to
diurese slowly in order to present a prerenal insult. She remained
symptom free for the duration of her hospital course.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient denies ever having had any
chest pain , but had known anatomy with single vessel disease ( RCA ).
Her history is suggestive of possible silent ischemia consistent
with her diabetic status. Her anginal equivalent appears to be
shortness of breath. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/18/12</PHI> with PTCA plus stent placement to her RCA with a good
result. She is on Ticlid for two weeks. Her blood pressure was
well controlled in her target range of 140-160 systolic blood
pressure on hydralazine , Lasix , and Lopressor. The day following
cardiac catheterization , her hematocrit and creatinine remained
stable at 30.9 and 3.7 , respectively. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/20/12</PHI> , her creatinine
increased to 4.2. This increase was thought to be due to a
combination of prerenal insult in addition to possible
dinephropathy. She was hydrated gently and her creatinine was
watched for the next two days , stabilizing in the 4.4 to 4.5 range.
3. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Etiology was unknown , possibly
secondary to diabetes mellitus or hypertensive nephropathy. She
has history of creatinine rises to high 3s and 4s during recent
hospitalizations. Hospital course is as described above. In
addition , Axid was changed to renal dosing ( q.day ) and the patient
was treated for a urinary tract infection. In reviewing the
hospital records , there is no evidence of previous work up for
renal artery stenosis. This patient with history and physical to
control blood pressures and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertension may benefit from further evaluation of possible renal
artery stenosis. This work up was deferred during this
hospitalization due to management of acute issues.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS: This was stable , diet controlled.
5. ANEMIA: The patient was worked up for her baseline low
hematocrit , found to have an iron deficiency anemia treated with
Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. Given her underlying renal failure ,
there may also be a renally driven component to her anemia and she
may benefit from Epogen as an outpatient.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition to follow up
with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Elisa Veilleux</PHI> , her cardiologist , in two weeks , and her
primary care physician in one week based on previously scheduled
appointment.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , hydralazine 50 mg
p.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual q. 5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Timoptic 0.25% one drop OU b.i.d. ,
Axid 150 mg p.o. q.day , and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two
weeks. Also , Niferex tablet 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have her
CBC checked at two weeks and four weeks
given her Ticlid therapy.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/4/2912</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE NOW STATUS POST PTCA
TIMES TWO AND STENT PLACEMENT.
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS/PROBLEM LIST: Coronary artery disease status
post three vessel CABG in 1981 ,
hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypertriglyceridemia , status post total hip replacement in 1990 ,
status post cholecystectomy , status post triple hernia repair.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ulloa</PHI> is a 71-year-old white
gentleman who has a history of
coronary artery disease , status post CABG in 1981 at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Natalie Umstead Clinic</PHI>
with unstable angina for further evaluation and treatment.
The patient's coronary risk factors include insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , hypertension , age , male gender ,
remote tobacco smoking and also known coronary artery disease.
The patient's cardiac history dates back to 1981 when he underwent
three vessel CABG at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> . The patient
has been in his usual state of health active in the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</PHI> until he
noticed progressive chest pain with chest tightness and shortness
of breath , but no light-headedness , nausea or vomiting which has
been progressing over the past few months. The patient did not
occur at rest , but occurred with minimal exertion. The patient had
an EKG as an outpatient which showed ST-T wave abnormalities and he
was advised to come to the hospital.
The patient presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nelda Uzzle Clinic</PHI> and was heparinized.
At that time his CKs were stable and his EKG did not show any
infarction. The patient had an echocardiogram and a Persantine
thallium stress test which was remarkably positive. The patient
developed substernal chest pain after one minute. The patient was
treated with 100 milligrams of aminophylline and two sublingual
nitroglycerines. His EKG revealed 2.5 millimeter ST depression in
leads 2 , AVf and V3-V6. His thallium images showed profusion
abnormalities in the posterolateral , anterior walls and also the
septum. The septum and apex were nearly completely filling in the
rest of the images.
The patient has now been transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further evaluation and intervention.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included the above. He had a CABG in
1981 and by office report , had an SVG to the
LAD in D1 and also and SVG to the distal RCA on OM1.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: On transfer , NPH insulin 12 units subcu q. h.s. ,
aspirin 81 milligrams p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.25
milligrams p.o. q.d. , Glucotrol 10 milligrams p.o. q. a.m. ,
gemfibrozil 600 milligrams p.o. q. h.s. , Atenolol 100 milligrams
p.o. q.d. , nitropaste 1" q.8h. , IV heparin 1000 units per hour ,
Colace 100 milligrams two b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works three times a week at the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</PHI>
and he has a remote history of tobacco with
smoking 1-1-1/2 packs per day for 20 years , but also quit 20 years
ago. The patient drinks infrequently , but used to drink more in
the past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease in his
sister and his brother. His brother had a CABG
at age 73.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient at this time denies any shortness
of breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
orthopnea or dyspnea on exertion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.0 , heart rate 49-53 , blood
pressure 140/70 , respirations 20 , O2
saturation 96% on room air. In general , the patient seemed
comfortable. His sclera were anicteric. JVP was 5 centimeters
with good carotids. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally
from anterior. Cardiovascular: Regular with a II-III/VI harsh
crescendo , decrescendo systolic murmur in the right upper sternal
border , and also a I-II/VI diastolic decrescendo murmur in the left
lower sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities showed 1+ pitting edema
to the mid shins. Neurologically , he was alert and oriented times
three. Extraocular movement are intact. Pupils are equal , round
and reactive to light , 3-4 millimeters bilaterally. Otherwise , his
examination was grossly nonfocal , but he has mild paresthesias
distally. Reflexes are 0 at the ankles , 0 at the ankles , but
symmetric and 2+ in the upper extremities.
LABORATORY: He has a normal SMA-7. His hematocrit is 41 with
WBCs 7.9 , platelet count 163 , 000. His CK is 104. His
LFTs are within normal limits.
His electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 51 with first
degree AV block and T wave inversions in 1 and L with ST-T wave
abnormalities in V4-V6.
His chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly with mild superior vascular
redistribution.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ulloa</PHI> was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory where a
catheterization revealed a left dominant system with a left main
that was okay and LAD was totally occluded proximally. The left
circumflex had 30% stenosis with 4-50% distal stenosis of the
bifurcation of the left PDA , also with a PDA of 80% lesion with PLV
of 40% and OM1 with a tubular 40% lesion. The RCA was totally
occluded at the ostial region , this was old. SVG to the LAD
looked okay , but the LAD itself distally had 90% lesions. The SVG
to the PDA to OM1 was totally occluded. The SVG to the diagonal
had a 95% ostial lesion. There was no MR. A PTCA was performed
with an SVG to the diagonal also with two 3.5 PS stents placed
resulting in 0% residual.
Also noted by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">EMDW</PHI> , is that the operative notes from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> from 1981 says that there are two skip SVG
to the PDA to the OM1 , also SVG to the D1 , to the LAD which is
incorrect. There are actually separate SVGs to LAD and to D1 and a
third SVG must be totally occluded to the PDA to OM1.
After the catheterization , the patient was admitted to the
Cardiology <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</PHI> Team where he continued to be heparinized and
supported with rate control awaiting a second cardiac
catheterization which was to correct the distal LAD lesions. The
patient had an unremarkable hospital course and underwent his
second cardiac catheterization and PTCA on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/3/12</PHI> which resulted
in the two distal LAD lesions which were each 90%. The patient
underwent PTCA to a residual of 10-20%.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and subsequently had a
very small left groin hematoma , but was otherwise okay. He
remained afebrile with stable vital signs and was discharged on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">10/4/12</PHI> in good stable condition.
DISPOSITION/FOLLOW UP: The patient was discharged in good and
stable condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/4/12.</PHI> He will
follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Whitley Newton</PHI> in 1-2 weeks. The patient also
will return to have his blood drawn for a CBC check in two weeks
and also in four weeks because he is discharged on Ticlid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o.
q.d. , Atenolol 100 milligrams p.o. q.d. ,
Captopril 25 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. , Gemfibrozil 600 milligrams

**********************hospital course***************************
1. PULM: admitted with mild worsening of chronic hypoxia related to
restrictive lung disease , obesity hypoventilation and obstructive sleep
apnea. Her baseline home oxygen requirement in 5-6L by nasal cannula
along with nasal BiPAP at night 16/8. She had decompensated to 7-8Lnc
and was complaining of dyspnea , both of which resolved with iv lasix
and 2-3liters negative diuresis. She is chronically deconditioned and
obese and refused to go to a rehabilitation facility , even pulmonary
rehab.
2. CV: followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LTTDR</PHI> of cardiology; diuresed with iv lasix and
diamox with bicard between 30-35 during admission. No active ichemic i
ssue or arrhythmias noted during admission. Discharged on home
diuretic regimen of 80mg lasix po qd with instructed to take an extra
pill once if she feels like her ankles are swelling or she is
particularly short of breath and no phone her physician.
3. ID: CXR negative for infiltrate , no fever no cough and no evidence
of pneumonia. Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Xuemei , Hart-Haynes Q</PHI> had her influenza vaccination this year
already.
4. Social: SW consulted , patient lives alone , has no support network
and is chronically noncompliant with medical and dietary
recommendations. Cardiac and pulmonary social work have both been
involved in her care in the past. PT consulted and recommended
pulmonary rehab , but patient refused. Her primary support is from an
internet friend who lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</PHI> and despite bargaining with staff
about which medicines to take and when to discharge her , she was well
enough to go on her scooter to visit "friends" in the hospital and get
high salt food from <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</PHI> She was discharged in stable condition with
oxygen back to her baseline levels of 96% on 5l nc and will follow up
with her pcp.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to eat a low salt , low total fluid diet. Follow up with your
primary care physician , you cardiology and your hematologist as
necessary. There are no increased oxygen requirements at this time. If
you feel like your ankles are swelling or you are having trouble
breathing , please take one extra lasix pill and call your physician for
further instructions.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CEREBRAL INFARCTIONS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
4. SICK SINUS SYNDROME STATUS POST DDDR
PACEMAKER.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Briefly , this is an 80 year-old woman with
coronary history of hypertension , diabetes and
atrial fibrillation admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nanci Norman Clinic</PHI> on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">17th February</PHI> for congestive heart failure and was at the time ,
diagnosed with receptive aphasia and a right hemianopsia. CT of
head was negative at that time and she was diagnosed with right MCA
stroke. She was started on anticoagulation as well as Lasix and
nitrites. Echocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed an
ejection fraction of 40 to 45%. She was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">20th of February</PHI> for further evaluation
here.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Sick sinus syndrome ,
complete heart block status post DDDR
pacemaker. 2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. DVT in 1992 ,
4. Right TKA , 5. Coronary artery disease , 6. CHF , 7.
Depression. 8. Diabetes. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Include quinidine , procainamide and disopyramide.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Heparin , Lasix , Insulin , Cozaar ,
Imdur , aspirin , Humulin and sotalol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for: She had a
temperature of 99.9 , blood
pressure of 108/54 , pulse of 78 , 95% on four liters. She is an
obese , elderly woman in no apparent distress. HEAD AND NECK: Exam
revealed oral mucosa was moist. Normocephalic , atraumatic. NECK:
Notable for JVD of 11 to 12 cm. , no bruits. LUNGS: Crackles 1/3
of the way up bilaterally. She had regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , benign. She had 1+
edema bilaterally; 1+ pulses. NEURO: Notable for alert and
oriented to time , place and person. Her language is notable for a
receptive aphasia. Her cranial nerves II through XII were intact
except for right hemianopsia. MOTOR: Gait was grossly normal.
Grip strength was 5/5 and symmetric. SENSORY: Grossly normal.
DTRs were 1+ and symmetric throughout. Toes were downgoing
bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Were noted before of BUN , creatinine of 26/0.8 ,
K of 2.4. LFTs were within normal limits.
Initial CK was 42. She had an LDL of 42 , HDL of 30. TSH was 1.89 ,
Troponin was 0.12. White count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 31 ,
platelets of 156. Her INR was 1.3 , PTT was 35.7 , urinalysis
revealed 40 to 50 white cells , 1+ bacteria and 2+ leukocyte
esterase. Her chest x-ray was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ORGAN SYSTEM: 1. Neuro: The patient was
likely to have a left MCA stroke
at the outside hospital. Repeat CT at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI>
confirmed these findings. She was continued on anticoagulation
since it was felt that most likely the etiology of stroke was
cardioembolic given her cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Of
note , she remained stable until the evening of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">20th</PHI> when she
was found to have depressed mental status and new left hemiparesis.
Repeated head CT was unchanged and she was felt to have a new right
MCA stroke again due to cardioembolic causes. At this time , the
family made a decision to make her DNR/DNI. She was continued on
aspirin and started on full heparinization. Her neurologic status
remained stable and she has improved slowly. Her swallowing
improved and over the next several days ate normally. She
continued to have a receptive aphasia although this improved and
she was able to repeat although her naming remained poor. Physical
therapy and speech were consulted and followed the patient. She
continues to do well. Follow-up CTs have remained unchanged. She
will undergo a SPECT examination to confirm this stroke but
otherwise she has been transitioned to Coumadin for long-term
anticoagulation.
2. Cardiovascular: She is felt to have , given her new depressed
ejection fraction and Troponin leak , she was felt to possibly have
coronary disease and she was expected to go to coronary angiography
given her progressive neurologic symptoms. This was deferred and
she will be continued on conservative therapy including aspirin and
anticoagulation. She was felt to be in some congestive heart
failure and has been diuresed gently with some improvement in her
oxygenation and cardiac exam. Her rhythm should remain at AV paced
without any services.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be referred to rehabilitation
center for further rehabilitation.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 81 mg p.o. q d , Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/20/2912</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 76 year old woman with
asthma. Presenting problem was
shortness of breath. Problem list included anxiety , status post
cholecystectomy in 1988 , headaches , asthma , hypertension , vertigo ,
question of pneumonia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> 1996. Patient's cardiac risk
factors included a history of hypertension , she had no known
history of elevated cholesterol , she did not smoke , and had no
history of diabetes or family history of cardiac disease. She had
no prior myocardial infarction and no history of angina. The
patient did have a history of asthma with no prior hospitalizations
or steroid tapers. She did take p.o. Proventil at night and there
were no pulmonary function tests available on record. Two days
prior to admission , the patient noted sudden onset of inability to
sleep secondary to shortness of breath when lying down. The
patient tried her inhaler without relief of symptoms. She also
noted an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient denied
fevers or chills. She reported that her symptoms did not improve
during the day and the night prior to admission , the patient noted
shortness of breath on exertion. She denied chest pain or chest
pressure. She had no diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or light
headedness. The patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI>
Emergency Department for persistent inability to sleep. On
evaluation in the Emergency Room , her blood pressure was 136/75
with a pulse of 124 , respiratory rate of 32 , and saturations of 94%
on room air. She was given nebulizers times three then 20 mg of
intravenous Lasix. She put out 600 cc of urine to that Lasix. The
Emergency Department then attempted to give her Verapamil 5 mg
times three to decrease her heart rate which was not effective.
The patient had no prior history of cardiac event. Her last
exercise test was in 1993. She went three minutes and five seconds
on the treadmill and stopped secondary to shortness of breath. Her
maximum heart rate was 130 with a maximum blood pressure of 190/80.
She had a baseline left bundle-branch block and therefore , her EKG
were not interpretable.
ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Meclizine 25 mg t.i.d. , Proventil tablet 4 mg
p.o. q.h.s. , oxazepam 10 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d. , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Habits included that patient did not drink alcohol
and she did not smoke cigarettes. Patient lived
at home with her family who were very involved with her care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was an elderly Hispanic woman in no
acute distress. Vital signs included a
temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 108/59 , pulse 101 , and
respiratory rates of 30 with saturations of 92% on three liters.
HEENT: Examination revealed a jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.
CHEST: Showed bilateral rales two thirds of the way up without
wheezes and no focal findings or egophony. CARDIAC: Examination
showed a regular rate and rhythm , tachycardic with a normal S1 and
S2 , no murmurs , and no S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Showed a well healed
surgical scar , breath sounds present , no hepatosplenomegaly , and no
hepatojugular reflux. EXTREMITIES: Without edema , clubbing , or
cyanosis and she had 2+ symmetrical distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was within normal limits with a BUN
of 15 and a creatinine of 1.0 , CBC showed
a white count of 9.45 , hematocrit of 36.5 , and platelets of 338.
CK was 110 and troponin was 0.0. Chest x-ray showed increased
heart size with bilateral increased interstitial markings
consistent with pulmonary edema and positive pulmonary vascular
redistribution. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats per
minute with normal intervals , an axis of negative 16 , a left
bundle-branch block , and no significant changes since <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/24/12.</PHI>
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for new onset congestive
heart failure. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. On the second day of hospitalization , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test MIBI on which she went four minutes and
eleven seconds on a modified Bruce protocol. She stopped secondary
to fatigue. She denied chest pain , there were no EKG changes , and
she had several bursts of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia
with exercise. Nuclear images revealed mild fixed reduced uptake
in the inferior wall consistent with a small injury but no evidence
of ongoing ischemia. An echocardiogram was also performed that
revealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She had mild mitral calcification
with mild regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , and a
normal right ventricular size and function. It was determined that
the patient would benefit from afterload reduction and inatropy
given her poor ejection fraction. She was started on Captopril ,
Digoxin , and Isordil in addition to the Lasix she had received upon
presentation for her congestive heart failure. The patient
tolerated these medications well and maintained a systolic blood
pressure of approximately 100 without symptoms of orthostasis.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
IDENTIFICATION: 81M with a h/o CAD s/p 2-vessel CABG , redo LIMA to LAD ,
and PCIx4 admitted w/ 2 month h/o increasingly frequent exertional CP.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HCMWGW</PHI> reports increasingly frequent exertional CP over the past 2
months that has been occurring about twice daily for the past 2 weeks.
Described as sub-sternal pressure , 5/10 , w/o radiation , and relieved
within 10-15 minutes of rest. Now occurring w/ walking 2-3 blocks at a
normal pace. Also describes near daily CP upon waking up , relieved
within 30 minutes of resting. Has not been taking sl. nitro. CP not
associated w/ SOB , nausea/vomiting , nor diaphoresis. No PND , orthopnea ,
palpitations , nor LE swelling.
For evaluation of these symptoms , he underwent a cardiac MRI , myocardial
perfusion w/ adenosine stress that was abnormal. Cardiac cath. was
recommended , but he sought a 2nd opinion at an <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Trisha?</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</PHI> On
arrival to this <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Trisha?</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22</PHI> , he was found to be diaphoretic and
orthostatic w/ an SBP as low as 70. He was thought to be volume-depleted
and admitted for further evaluation. No EKG changes were noted and
cardiac enzymes were negativex3. It was recommended to proceed to
cardiac cath. at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Trisha?</PHI> . He chose to come to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> ( b/c all of his cardiac
care in the past has been here ) and was transferred on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/23</PHI> for elective
cardiac cath.
No CP , nor SOB at admission.

8. STATUS POST PACEMAKER PLACEMENT , 1993.
9. STATUS POST AAA REPAIR IN 1994.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75 year old with a long
history of coronary artery disease who
presents with unstable angina.
The patient has a long history of stable and unstable angina ,
suffered a nonQ-wave myocardial infarction <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10.</PHI>
PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1978 - myocardial infarction. 1980 -
coronary artery bypass graft with porcine
mitral valve replacement. Saphenous vein grafts were performed on
the LAD , PDA arteries. 1991 - Repeat coronary artery bypass graft
because of recurrent angina , LIMA to LAD graft. <PHI TYPE="DATE">12-07</PHI> - Laser
angioplasty. <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-08</PHI> - Laser angioplasty. <PHI TYPE="DATE">10-08</PHI> - Episodes of TIA ,
seizures and was begun on Coumadin. <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10</PHI> - Abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair , nonQ-wave myocardial infarction by enzymes at
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nanci Norman Clinic</PHI> .
Since <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> 1995 he has had worsening of his angina to the point
where he had it several times a week while walking very short
distances. He required prophylactic nitroglycerin before walking.
In the week prior to admission , the angina increased to several
times a day , requiring 2 or 3 nitroglycerins for relief where as
before required only 1.
On the day prior to admission , he had recurrent chest pain which
was unresponsive to nitroglycerin. He presents originally to the
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nanci Norman Clinic</PHI> ER where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin
and heparin and had recurring chest pain.
He was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further
management.
At the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> he ruled in for myocardial
infarction with CKs in the low 300s , MB of 29.8. He was taken to
the cath lab where an angiography showed an occluded left
circumflex and an occluded LAD path of the first diagonal and
occluded proximal RCA , occluded saphenous vein graft to the LAD and
occluded saphenous vein graft to his OM and patent LIMA to LAD and
saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As summarized above under significant
problems.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nanci Norman Clinic</PHI> : Isordil 20
t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Dilantin
100 t.i.d. , proscar 5 mg q.d. , Hytrin 2 mg q.d. , IV heparin and IV
TNG.
ALLERGIES: None known.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his wife , former employee of the
<PHI TYPE="LOCATION">California</PHI>
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Elderly , moderately obese man
in no current distress. Heart rate is 63 to
75 , blood pressure 108/64 , R 10-14. HEENT - Within normal limits.
Neck - No jugular venous distention. CV - Regular rate and rhythm
with a systolic 1/6 murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Lungs - Crackles 1/3 of the way up.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission - Normal electrolytes , creatinine ,
CBC - hematocrit 35 , platelets 43 , 000 , PT/PTT
19.2 and 6.1 , respectively. CK were 311 and 333.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CCU and was taken
to the Cardiac Cath Lab with cardiac
catheterization as detailed above. The decision at that time was
made that his findings were not amenable to angioplasty or to
surgical intervention. He was put on an intra-aortic balloon pump
following catheterization. Medications were increased to relieve
after load and decreased ischemia.
His course in the CCU was notable for continued episodes of chest
pain and difficulty weaning from the intra-aortic balloon pump. He
was seen by the cardiac surgery team and they did not feel he was
amenable to revascularization. In addition , he was not a candidate
for laser revascularization protocol under Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LTCD</PHI> and that
protocol was closed.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI> the patient was successfully weaned from intra-aortic
balloon pump and did not have further chest pain at that time. He
was at this point using SL nitroglycerin prophylactically. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-9</PHI>
the patient was transferred to Cardiology <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</PHI> Service.
On the floor , the patient continued to have episodes of chest pain
up to 2 or 3 times a day which were relieved with nitroglycerin SL.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-10</PHI> he had more severe episode of chest pain refractory to 3
nitroglycerin and eventually improved with 6 mg of morphine and 10
mg of IV Lopressor. His pain had occurred at rest and lasted a
total of approximately one hour. After this event , the angioplasty
team was reconsulted concerning the possibility of addressing some
of the patient's cardiac lesions. It was agreed that this is a
high risk procedure but after extensive discussion with him and his
family; both decided to attempt an angioplasty of his LAD lesion.
He was briefly admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">UHX</PHI> for intra-aortic balloon pump
prior to the procedure and subsequently on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-12</PHI> underwent PTCA of
his distal LAD to a 30% residual stenosis. He also underwent PTCA
of his proximal LAD to residual 20% stenosis. He was successfully
and rapidly weaned from the intra-aortic balloon pump and
readmitted to the cardiology <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</PHI> service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-13-10.</PHI>
The patient's subsequent course was characterized by decreasing
episodes of chest pain. He began to ambulate in his room and
subsequently around the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</PHI> without chest pain. He continued
throughout final week of hospitalization to have one episode of
chest pain on awakening , always relieved with 1 SL nitroglycerin
and occasionally relieved without any nitroglycerin.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-19-10</PHI> , the patient was in good condition without angina ,
walking around the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</PHI> and scheduled to be transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanda Gillespie Claudine.</PHI> He has also undergone anticoagulation
with Coumadin for his dyskinesis. He is discharged with a good
INR. He has upon discharge a 24 hour Holter monitor that is
pending which was performed to evaluate his pacer function.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Asthma exacerbation.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
4. Sleep apnea.
5. Hypertension.
6. Obesity.
7. Tobacco history.
HISTORY: A 61-year-old female with a long tobacco
history of COPD , and recently diagnosed
sleep apnea is admitted with an asthma flare. In 1981 , she had a
DVT which required IVC filter placement. In 1983 , she had a
nonQ-wave MI and cath at that time showed an 80% proximal LAD
stenosis , 30% RCA stenosis treated medically. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1991 ,
the patient had an exercise test in which she went four minutes
in 28 seconds , stopped because of fatigue and there were no
diagnostic EKG changes. PFT's at that time were reportedly
normal , although details are not available at this time.
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1991 , further evaluation of the patient's dyspnea
included multiple normal EKG's , a low probable VQ scan. She was
treated with steroids and inhalers ( Bronchosol ) with good relief.
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1991 , the patient had recurrent dyspnea on exertion. She
ruled out for an MI at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> . Repeat Cath
showed an LAD stenosis of 40% , RCA of 80% and an ejection
fraction of 73%. She was discharged on medical management.
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1991 , the patient was diagnosed with "asthma"/COPD
and had another rule out MI for dyspnea. At that time , she had
another ETT in which she went four minutes and 45 seconds ,
stopped secondary to chest pain , however , the EKG was
nondiagnostic. Thallium showed fixed anterior defects ( although
the effects overlying breast tissue cannot be ruled out ).
Bronchoscopy showed mild bronchitis and , since that time , she was
discharged on a prednisone taper which had gradually been tapered
down to 11 mg a day.
Of note , the patient also has been diagnosed with sleep apnea for
which she is on nasal CPAP. She sleeps in a chair due to
orthopnea and occasionally has paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The most recent pulmonary function tests ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1992 ) showed an
FEV1 of 1.76 , an FVC of 2.5 , ratio of 70% , DLCO of 28.3. A
twenty-four holter was negative for arrhythmias. Exercise test
at that time , she went nine minutes and had no ST changes.
Thallium images were again unremarkable.
One week prior to admission , the patient developed symptoms of
upper respiratory infection including sneezing , rhinorrhea ,
headache and had increased shortness of breath. Steroids were
increased as were nebulizers with symptomatic improvement. Over
the five days prior to admission , the patient had increasing
shortness of breath , wheezing worse at night. She denies fevers ,
chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , chest pain , abdominal pain ,
cough , rash or joint pain.
In the Emergency Room , the patient was in marked respiratory
distress for which she was given nebulizer and begun on IV Solu-
Medrol. Peak flow at that time was 180.
Past medical history , COPD , coronary artery disease status post
nonQ-wave MI 1983. Obesity. Sleep apnea. Allergic rhinitis.
Status post cholecystectomy. Benign breast cyst resection.
History of labyrinthitis. History of Sjogren's disease with a
positive anti DNA antibody. History of DVT status post IVC
filter in 1983.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa has caused swollen mouth ,
Theophylline causes jitteriness.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizers t.i.d.; Kay-Ciel
8 mEq q.d.; Prednisone 11 mg q.d.;
Guanfacine 600 mg b.i.d.; Verapamil 240 SR q.d.; Lasix 40 mg
b.i.d. ( q.d. if feels okay ). Cromolyn nebs q. 6 hours ( rarely
uses ); Nasobid inhaler b.i.d.; Ranitidine q. h.s. HABITS:
Tobacco history , quit approximately two years ago , rare alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Obese , pleasant female in mild shortness
of breath initially but responded to
nebs and steroids. Otopharynx was clear. There was no thrush.
NECK: Supple. Carotids 2+. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and
rhythm , very distant. LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at bases ,
scant wheezes , no crackles. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender.
EXTREMITIES: Obese , no marked edema , although difficult to
assess secondary to obesity. SKIN: No visible lesion.
NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly within normal limits.
LABORATORY DATA: Potassium 3.6 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.9 ,
white count 15.1 , urinalysis negative.
Chest X-ray , no significant disease except for a question of mild
CHF changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated with IV
steroids , nebulizers , oxygen , and did
quite well. The trigger for her asthma remains illusive. She
underwent an esophageal acid study to rule out subclinical
aspiration ( results pending at the time of discharge ). There was
no infectious component to her exacerbation detected , although
preceding viral illness cannot be excluded. The patient was
treated with subcutaneous Heparin for DVT risks.
On hospital day number four , the patient was converted to
Prednisone without complications. She had no episodes of chest
pain and there was no evidence for ischemic etiology.
At the time of discharge , the patient's peak flows were greater
than 500 and her lung exam had cleared remarkably. She is
transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Izola German Clinic</PHI> for respiratory
rehabilitation on the following medications: Aspirin one tablet
p.o. q.d.; Atrovent puffers two puffs q. 4 hours; Beconase nasal
inhaler two puffs q. 6 hours; Heparin 10 , 000 units subcutaneous
b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg q. h.s.; Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. d. ( taper
as tolerated ); Albuterol nebulized treatments q. 4 hours as
needed; Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Verapamil SR 240 mg p.o. q.d.;
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. a.m. p.r.n.; Beclovent neb six puffs p.o.
q.i.d.
ADDENDUM:
Regarding the patient's esophagram results , the patient had a
48-hour esophageal pH monitor which showed that the patient has
reflux episodes and parameters which are within normal limits;
however , 4/7 cough episodes are correlated with the patient's
cough and asthma flares are possibly related to her reflux
symptoms; however , the study was not completely diagnostic.
Benefit from anti-reflux medications such as Reglan on a
diagnostic and therapeutic trial , we should also consider further
gastroesophageal reflux studies such as manometry as an
outpatient.

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Chest x-ray performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/09/2921</PHI>
by <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Powell Yousef</PHI> showing mild pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram
performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/09/2921</PHI> by <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yerton Addie</PHI> showing no significant
change from previous done <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/06/2918.</PHI> Ejection fraction of 25% ,

similar findings. Head CT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/10/2921</PHI> by <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yuhas Arlene</PHI> showed
prominent ventricles and sulci that appear appropriate for the
patient's age. No acute intracranial process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted with an elevated
BNP and chest x-ray consistent with CHF flare , likely secondary
to UTI. On arrival to the floor , the patient was hemodynamically
stable and asymptomatic. EKG and one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative for cardiac ischemia and his home cardiac medications
were restarted. On examination , the patient had elevated JVP and
edema , suggesting that he was volume overloaded. The patient
responded to diuresis with torsemide 5 mg IV and metolazone 2.5
mg by mouth. He was switched to his home dose of torsemide 30 mg
p.o. and was euvolemic on discharge. Echocardiogram was
performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/10/2921</PHI> to rule out structure etiologies for CHF
flare. Results showed no significant change from previous echo
done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/07/2921.</PHI> The patient was on telemetry during the
hospital course and was noted to have atrial fibrillation with
premature ventricular contractions. He remained asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course.
2. ID: UTI contributing to his CHF flare and MS changes.
Urinalysis was positive and the outside hospital reported
Gram-negative rods. The patient was continued on a 10-day course
of p.o. Levaquin. TP-IgG was negative.
3. Pulmonary: Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. The patient remained asymptomatic
with no oxygen requirement. The patient responded well to
diuretic therapy for CHF flare.
4. Neurology: The patient's altered mental status was thought
to be secondary to urinary tract infection without metabolic
causes. B12 , folate , TSH , and T4 were within normal limits.
TP-IgG was negative. Iron was slow with small hypochromia on
smear , suggesting mild iron deficiency. EEG was also performed
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/10/2921</PHI> as this patient displayed fluctuations in cognitive
function that could be related to seizure activity. EEG was
nondiagnostic for epileptiform features. The patient was started
on Keppra 500 mg twice a day. His mental status appeared to be at baseline at
time of discharge
5. Renal: Creatinine 1.4 , baseline creatinine was monitored
during diuresis. Creatinine trended down to 1.3 on discharge.
Gross hematuria was present upon arrival to floor secondary to
patient pulling on catheter in his altered mental state. Bladder
scan ruled out obstruction and the bladder was irrigated to
remove clots. As the patient's mental status improved , he no
longer pulled on the catheter and the hematuria resolved. He
continued to have some bleeding around the catheter secondary to
BPH and the trauma from manipulation of the catheter.
6. Wounds: The patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the left
Achilles , recently seen at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> by Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Travis.</PHI> , Plastic Surgery. He saw the patient and recommended
Panafil spray for the wound and frequent dressing changes. The
patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Travis.</PHI> as an outpatient.
7. GI: Distended abdomen with question of ascites. LFTs
returned within normal limits , no indication for ultrasound.
8. Hematology: Hematuria as described above which resolved with
improved mental status. The patient's hematocrit remained stable
throughout the hospital course. The patient has a history of
elevated INR , resistant to p.o. and subcutaneous vitamin K.
Records from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Claude Vargas</PHI> suggest that the patient has factor
VII deficiency. The patient had no episodes of uncontrollable
bleeding or symptoms suggesting anticoagulative state.
9. Endocrine: Continued the patient's home dose of Synthroid.
Diabetes type 2 covered Lantus 10 units and insulin aspart
sliding scale.
10: Fen: Potassium/magnesium scales. cardiac ,
low salt diet.
11. Prophylaxis: Proton pump inhibitor , Lovenox.
12. Code: The patient is DNR/DNI. There were no complications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours by mouth , aspirin 81 mg once daily
by mouth , Dulcolax 5 mg daily by mouth for constipation , calcium
carbonate 500 mg 3 times a day by mouth , Celexa 20 mg daily , by

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. Poorly controlled hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">OWCSG</PHI> is a 62-year-old woman with
cardiac risk factors of hypertension ,
diabetes , a positive family history , and coronary disease
documented by a prior myocardial infarction who presented with
increased leg swelling , a 21 lb weight gain over the last three
months and who was seen in Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 3</PHI> , 1996 , by Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Johnny , Nicholson R.</PHI> , and was admitted for management. She had a myocardial
infarction in 1981 and , in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1995 , she had a three vessel CABG
which included a LIMA graft to the LAD and two saphenous vein
grafts to the OM and to the PDA. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> 1995 , her postoperative
course had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusion
which required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as a
thorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication and
drainage of effusions. At this time , she had also been dyspneic on
exertion along with shortness of breath at rest. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 15</PHI> , 1995 ,
she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated left
ventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch
block , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitral
calcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.
A Bovie study was also performed and was negative. She also
presented with some biventricular failure and diuresis was
attempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. Over the past two
months , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gained
approximately 21 lb since <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 28</PHI> , 1995. She has been quite
active and not limited. However , the edema has been her most
limiting factor. Three nights prior to admission , she had dyspnea
on exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no chest
pain and compression boots were attempted to try to alleviate some
of the edema. She had no orthopnea. She claims to have no dietary
indiscretions , no fevers , no sweats , no chills , no coughs , no chest
pain , no abdominal pain , and no bright red blood per rectum , but
she was more fatigued. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 3</PHI> , 1996 , she was seen in Clinic
by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Johnny , Nicholson R.</PHI> and was seen to have increased leg edema and
increased dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs. An echo was
performed and showed decreased left ventricular function within an
EF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> 1995. Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented
0.4 , which was negative. Echo report also showed some inferior
posterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspid
insufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested PA
pressures of about 41 mmHg. The patient was subsequently admitted
for management of her congestive heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction in 1981 , hypertension
with systolics in the 200s , which has been difficult to control ,
diabetes for which she has been on insulin. She has a history of
an amaurosis fugax in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1995 and was started on Coumadin in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI>
1995. She has a history of the loculated pleural effusions and a
history of TIA while being on Coumadin. She also has a history of
kidney stones.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG times three in 1995 , right CEA in
1993 , and right mastoid surgery.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Ceclor which cause a rash.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin NPH
35 units q.a.m. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Procardia XL 30 mg p.o.
p.r.n. , and Slow KCl.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother who had a myocardial
infarction at age 40 and 60. Father died of a
myocardial infarction at age 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a rather obese woman ,
totally edematous , who was slightly short of
breath while talking. Her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure
211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on room
air. Her neck examination was significant for a jugular venous
pulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. Her
carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there was
a right CEA scar. Her chest examination was significant for few
crackles at bilateral bases. Cardiac examination showed a normal
S1 , S2 , but with a faint S3. Abdominal examination had a positive
fluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upper
quadrant. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to knees
bilaterally. DP pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses were
unable to be palpated. Her weight , at the time of admission , was
233 lb.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values were unremarkable at the time
of admission. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of
64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentially
since <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1995. Chest x-ray , on admission , showed increased
interstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleural
effusion. There was also some left lower lobe scarring and there
was an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent with
increased initial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix for the
first three hospital days , during which she lost
approximately 17 lb. She was then switched to p.o. Lasix on
hospital day four , and continued to diurese. She was placed on
strict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. Her blood
pressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1
blocker and ACE inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. Her
calcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diurese
her. Her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of NPH
dose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlled
an CZI sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units of NPH. By
hospital day five , the patient was stable on the staple regimen.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 20 units subcutaneous
q.a.m. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.6h. ,
nitroglycerin NTG 1/150 sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n.
chest pain , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl slow release 32 mEq p.o. b.i.d. ,
ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times three days.
COMPLICATIONS: The patient had irritation of her bladder from her
Foley catheter and produced some bloody urine and
then upon discontinuing the Foley catheter had some burning of her
urine for which a urinalysis was performed. She was placed on
ofloxacin for three days.
DISPOSITION: The patient was stable upon discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Johnny , Nicholson R.</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 10</PHI> ,
1996 at 12:30 p.m. during a scheduled appointment. She
is also to follow up with <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yetter Uresti</PHI> , her nurse at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Omar Infirmary</PHI> to
follow up on her blood sugar control. The patient will also have a
VNA sent to see her three times a week for vital signs check ,
weight medical , pharmaceutical compliance , and her weights will be
called in to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Johnny , Nicholson R.</PHI> She should also improve upon her
physical therapy and increase her abilities for ambulation.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest and left arm pain , and left arm paresthesias.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 47-year-old female with a past medical history , which
includes HIV positive , hepatitis C positive , seizures , and
neuropathy , who presented complaining of left hand paresthesias
followed by left hand pain that marches proximally up her left
arm and affecting her left shoulder and chest. Along with these
symptoms , she has associated shortness of breath , palpitations ,
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and nausea. The patient notes that
these symptoms have been occurring approximately five times per
week over the past two months. She has notified her PCP of these
events , however , the etiology has never been identified. Of
note , the patient states that these symptoms have increased in
frequency since having two syncopal events , which occurred three
days prior to admission.
Regarding syncope , the patient recalls her first loss of
consciousness episode occurring three days ago in her bedroom.
There were no antecedent symptoms. She came back to
consciousness while on the ground , called out for help and her
daughter came immediately. There was no witnessed seizure
activity , no postictal confusion , no tongue trauma nor was there
any incontinence. A second episode of syncope occurred two days
prior to arrival while the patient was standing in the bathroom.
There was some preceding lightheadedness this time. The
post-event characteristics were the same. Again , the patient was
found by her son when she called out for help.
The patient denies prior history of syncopal events , however , she
does have a lifelong history of seizures and has not been taking
her Keppra for approximately a year , as her prescription has ran
out and she has failed to keep follow-up appointments with her
primary neurologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Quijano Inocencia.</PHI> Both the patient and her
daughter note that she usually has postictal confusion and that
these syncopal events did not fit that description. Furthermore ,
these episodes did not feel like her occasional hypoglycemic
episodes. Unfortunately , the patient's blood sugars were not
obtained during these syncopal events.
Of note , the patient recently started Flexeril to treat chronic
low back pain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient admits stable three-pillow orthopnea , but new
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no lower extremity edema , weight
loss or increased abdominal girth. The patient has stable
four-block ambulation limited by dyspnea. She has had notable
weight loss as she has decreased in dress size from 18-14 over
the past nine months. She denies fevers or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
HIV positive , drug-seeking behavior , parotitis , migraine
headaches , anxiety and panic , depression , hepatitis C , seizures ,
neuropathy , pancreatitis , abnormal Pap smear , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral aneurysm , herpes simplex type 1 , and chronic low back
pain.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:

ADMISSION DATA:
Chest x-ray was within normal limits. EKG was normal sinus
rhythm without ischemic change. CAT scan of the head was within
normal limits. Left shoulder and arm plain films were negative
for fracture or dislocation.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 47-year-old female with a history significant for HIV ,
diabetes , questionable cerebral aneurysm , and seizure disorder
( not taking Keppra for the past year ) , who recently had two
syncopal events without prodrome and without postictal state
( thus unlikely a seizure in etiology ) , who presented for
evaluation of left arm paresthesias and chest pain , with
associated diaphoresis , shortness of breath and nausea , which has
been intermittently occurring over the past two months.
During this admission , the patient had frequent recurrences of
her left arm and chest pain symptoms , which were related to
syncopal events. Thus , the medical team does not think that
these two issues are related. The patient underwent an extensive
syncopal evaluation , however , the etiology was never identified.
The etiology of the patient's left arm and chest symptoms and
syndromes also was not identified during this admission , however ,
the medical team suspects it may be related to a cervical spinous
process , potentially arthritis , disc herniation or nerve root
impingement. Please see below for more details. The remainder
of the dictation will be divided into system:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient underwent an extensive
cardiovascular evaluation , all of which was negative.
a. Pump: Given the patient's history of HIV and taking
antiretroviral , there was a concern about associated
cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram that was performed was completely
within normal limits. The patient did not exhibit signs of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea during this admission.
Dyspnea on exertion could be related to decondition.
b. Rhythm: The patient's telemetry history on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/14/2921</PHI> was
notable for a nonsustained 5-beat run of wide complex tachycardia
with rates in the 150's. This was immediately followed by a
nonsustained 4-beat run of narrow complex tachycardia.
Cardiology consult was placed to review the telemetry strip and
to assess for referral to EP Service for potential AICD. Given
the negative echocardiogram , the Card Service wanted to rule out
ischemia-induced arrhythmia , so a MIBI was performed , and the
patient was started on low-dose beta-blocker and aspirin. The
adenosine MIBI was within normal limits. The telemetry strip was
reviewed by the EP Service and diagnosed the patient with
nonsustained SVT with aberrancy. The Card Service then advised
that there was no need for AICD. They stated that if tolerated ,
the beta-blocker could be continued and that the patient should
be set up as an outpatient for a loop recorder. This will be
coordinated through the patient's PCP. Of note , after starting
metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d. , the patient had occasional bradycardia to
the high 40's. Thus , it was determined that this medication
should be discontinued as it may be impairing the patient's
exercise tolerance.
c. Ischemia: Coronary disease risk factors include diabetes and
family history. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction , had
no ischemic change on her EKG , and had a negative MIBI. No
further workup for coronary artery disease was indicated. A
lipid panel was completely within normal limits and suggesting
treatment was not indicated.
d. Miscellaneous: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17/2921</PHI> , the patient was evaluated for
one of her left arm and chest pain events. The patient was noted
to be diaphoretic and complained of nausea and shortness of
breath. The symptoms occurred while the patient was lying in
bed. Upon arrival by the team , her blood pressure was 90/56 ,
heart rate was 56 , she had poor pallor , was diaphoretic , and
described chest pain radiating up and down her arm. EKG in
telemetry during the event was normal sinus rhythm with any acute
ST or T-wave changes. The event spontaneously resolved in less
than 15 minutes without medical intervention.
2. Neuro: The patient has a history of convulsive seizures and
has been noncompliant with Keppra for the past 12 months because
she failed to keep neuro appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Quijano Inocencia.</PHI> and has
been unable to obtain refills. Per the patient , her recent
syncopal events were without prodrome and without postictal
state. Thus , were unlikely prior seizures and unlikely seizure
in focus. An EEG was performed during this admission and
demonstrated no definite focal or epileptiform features. Keppra
was restarted at 250 mg b.i.d. with a goal to increase to 500 mg
b.i.d. after 7 days and to 750 mg after another week. There was
a question of a history of cerebral aneurysm , diagnosed at an
outside facility , which was never confirmed by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> imaging. MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck
obtained this admission was negative for hemorrhage , mass , edema ,
hydrocephalus , infarction , and negative for abnormal enhancement.
There was no aneurysm high-flow AVM or stenosis found , and MRA
of the neck had no significant abnormality. The patient's
neurologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Quijano Inocencia.</PHI> , was aware of this admission. A
follow-up appointment has been made.
3. Endocrine: History of diabetes type II , hemoglobin A1c of
6.1 , reflects excellent outpatient glycemic control , however , the
patient reports becoming diaphoretic with normal glycemic levels
between 80 and 100. Given recent weight loss without glyburide
dose adjustment , the medical team decreased glyburide to 2.5 mg
daily for the patient to begin upon discharge. During this
admission , the all oral agents were held and the patient was
treated with the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vallejo , Voigt Mollie Izzo Woodrow</PHI> insulin protocol.
4. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of HIV
positive , CD4 count on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/10/2921</PHI> was 217. The viral load was
less than assay. The patient continued on Truvada and Lexiva.
The patient complained of dysuria on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15/2921.</PHI> Urinalysis was
ordered , but symptoms resolved before specimen could be sent the
lab.
5. Pain: History of chronic pain and lumbar spine herniations.
The methadone dose of 155 mg was confirmed with the outpatient
clinic. No additional regular narcotics were given during this
admission.
6. Heme: The patient has chronic pancytopenia. She has a
normocytic normochromic anemia with normal iron studies , B12 and
folate , and a low reticulocyte index consistent with anemia of
chronic disease , likely from HIV immunosuppression.
7. Miscellaneous: The patient was screened by the Physical
Therapy Service who recommended a home safety evaluation. This
will be coordinated to the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</PHI> Visiting Nurses Association.
Given the liability and predictability of events , the team
implemented a 24-hour urine collection to assess for
pheochromocytoma. The results of the studies are pending at the
time of this discharge. The patient may have autonomic
dysregulation as part of her diabetes. Alternatively , the
medical team speculates that the patient may have cervical spinal
arthritis , lumbar herniation or nerve root impingement
contributing to these symptoms. Of note , the patient states that
these episodes had occurred more frequently inpatient and they
were at home. It was until the day of discharge that it was
noted that the patient was not receiving her Klonopin 1 mg q.i.d.
as she had prior to admission. In fact , she has only received
three doses of Klonopin over a six-day period. It is unclear
what role anxiety is playing into these events. On the day of
discharge , the patient stated that she was making arrangements to
see an orthopedic specialist at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Doris Steven Verdin Clinic</PHI> for
evaluation of her cervical spine.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Syncope , not otherwise specified.
2. Left arm pain/left chest pain/left arm paresthesias ( not
otherwise specified ).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Ecotrin 81 mg daily , clonazepam 1 mg q.6 h. p.r.n. , Imodium one
to two tablets q.i.d. p.r.n. for diarrhea , Truvada one tablet
p.o. daily , Lexiva 1400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg daily ,
Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. for 14 doses and then 750 mg b.i.d.
indefinitely , methadone 155 mg daily , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. ,
Zoloft 300 mg daily , trazodone 100 mg at bedtime p.r.n. , and
Zofran 4 mg daily p.r.n. for nausea.
MEDICAL FOLLOW UP:

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
59 year-old right-handed woman admitted for suspected acute stroke. Her
PMH includes HTN , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA vs. stroke <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/2917</PHI>
( manifest as slurred speech , left arm and leg weakness ). prior
myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , and history of left Bell's palsy x 3 with
chronic weakness of facial expression muscles on the left. She had a
possible patent foramen ovale with agitated saline contrast passage on
valsalva maneuver TTE when she was admitted <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/06</PHI> for stroke work-up.
Recently , this woman has had 2-weeks of general fatigue , exertional dys
pnea , frequent headaches , and intermittent blurred vision while driving
followed by a 2-3 second episode of binocular visual loss <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/10/18.</PHI>
Notably , she ran out of amlodipine and reports obtaining a level of
240/150 on self-monitoring. One day prior to admission she saw her PCP
who noted hypertension and referred her to an ophthalmologist , who
obtained a normal exam by report.
She awoke this morning with a more severe right frontal headache with
pain radiating to the right shoulder. She also experienced a problem
with gait , leaning to the right. Her husband phoned EMS because she had
a severe headache and seemed "confused." At present , the patient denies
headache and confusion , as well as diplopia , vertigo , dysphagia , and
dysarthria. She denies recent chest pain , but has had orthopnea.
PMHx: hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA versus stroke ,
prior myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent
left Bell's palsy , allergic rhinitis , chronic renal insufficiency
( baseline creatinine around 1.5 )
Meds: ASA 81 , HCTZ , atenolol , amlodipine , atorvastatin , loratadine , PRN
albuterol
All: iodinated contrast , losartan
VS: T 97.2 HR 57 BP 150/90
GEN obese woman , comfortable HEENT sclerae anicteric , oral mucosa moist
NECK: no bruits
HEART mild bradycardia , regular rhythm , II/VI SEM at USB ABD soft ,
nontender , nondistended EXT: no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema; radial
and dorsalis pedis pulses 2+
NEURO: MS significant for no deficits on orientation , attention , langua
ge , memory , and praxis. CN exam significant for right hypertropic skew ,
left facial droop , mostly lower face but with weak eyebrow raise as
well. Motor exam with normal tone , no pronator drift , strength 5/5 in
all muscle groups in upper and lower extremities. Coordination exam
with slightly slowed fine finger movements , right hand , normal
performance on finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin , sensory exam
without deficits in light touch , temperature , vibratory sensation ,
reflexes 2 throughout except for 1 in the ankles , toes downgoing
bilaterally. GAIT slightly wided based but stable gait with upright
posture , normal arm-swing. No difficulty with heel , or toe walk. Falls
to left on tandem gait.
Non-contrast head CT negative for evidence of stroke or hemorrhage.
Hospital course: the pt was admitted with hypertension and recent
headaches , visual changes ( blurred vision ) , change in gait ( inability
to walk in heels ) , and recent confusion. Neurologic exam was
significant for right hypertropic skew without diplopia , left facial
weakness that is old per pt and LMR notes , mild slowing of right fine
finger movements , and tendency to fall towards the left on tandem gait.
These findings do not localize well and the differential diagnosis
was felt to include cerebral ischemia/infarction and hypertensive
encephalopathy. The patient had recent poorly-controlled
hypertension as well as symptoms of possible heart failure including
exertional dyspnea and orthopnea.
An MRI was ordered to evaluate for possible stroke or hypertensive
encephalopathy. Unfortunately , the pt was not able to tolerate the
procedure , citing claustrophobia from a traumatic childhood experience
as a prohibitive factor. Her atenolol was continued and she was placed
on aspirin 325 mg qd for stroke and heart prophylaxis. Her blood
pressures remained well-controlled throughout admission and she
remained asymptomatic , without recurrent headache , confusion , and
weakness. Her fine finger movements with the right hand were improved
by hospital day 2. She continued to have difficulty with tandem gait ,
falling to the left. Her lipid profile revealed elevated total
cholesterol and LDL. Her homocysteine level was slightly elevated at
14. She was instructed to raise her dose of atorvastatin as well as
supplement her diet with folic acid. She has an outpt appointment for
carotid non-invasive studies <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/18/18.</PHI>
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
The pt should take a full dose of aspirin ( 325 mg ). She should take
folate supplementation. She should also discuss raising her dose of
atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) with her PCP , because her cholesterol and LDL
were elevated this admission.

OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/4/14</PHI> , cardiac catheterization and
echocardiogram.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vaillancourt Ugalde</PHI> is a 52 year old Asian
male with known coronary artery
disease and extensive cardiac history , including: ( 1 ) In 1988 , the
patient had a CABG x2 vessels ( LIMA to LAD and RIMA to PDA ); ( 2 )
PTCA to PDA in 1994; ( 3 ) PTCA of LAD ( proximal to LIMA and left
circumflex ) including stent in <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/13.</PHI> The patient discharged
himself AMA at that time. ( 4 ) The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17/13</PHI>
for symptoms consistent with CHF. He had a dobutamine MIBI at that
time , which was markedly positive with significant ST changes in
the inferior leads. He underwent a cardiac catheterization , where
a 90% long instant restenosis was found in the left circumflex.
The area was rotablated , and then angioplastied. During the
procedure , the patient experienced episodes of asystole. A V-pacer
was placed. The pacer was D/C'd the next morning , and the patient
was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/22/13.</PHI>
Since that time , the patient states he has been pain free , except
when he exercises on the treadmill. He , therefore , takes one
sublingual nitroglycerin before and one after the treadmill.
However , the patient now reports that he has developed rest angina
over the past two weeks. The patient states that he has q. day
rest pain , with approximately 1-3 episodes per day relieved by one
sublingual nitroglycerin and lasting for minutes of each episode.
On the day of admission , the patient presented to his primary care
doctor at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CECH</PHI> for upper respiratory infection symptoms , which
started approximately on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/27/13.</PHI> The patient felt chest pain
again while walking up the stairs to his doctor's office. He
reported this to the doctor , and was sent to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> for further evaluation.
On presentation , he denies nausea , vomiting , or arm tingling. He
does report occasional shortness of breath and intermittent
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ? no orthopnea. He sleeps with one
pillow. His other review of systems was positive for productive
cough over the past week , yellow phlegm , no fevers or chills ,
diarrhea , or other. He was pain free in the Emergency Room. The
patient was therefore admitted with a diagnosis of unstable angina
for further evaluation. He was heparinized in the Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease status post a
CABG in 1988; ( 2 ) PTCA in 1994; ( 3 ) Status
post rotablation in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/98;</PHI> ( 4 ) Hyperlipidemia; ( 5 ) Focal/segmental
glomerulosclerosis. His peak creatinine was 3.4 after his last
dye; ( 6 ) Chronic renal insufficiency; ( 7 ) Gout; ( 8 ) Status post lap
cholecystectomy in 1997; ( 9 ) No history of diabetes mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; nitroglycerin SL
p.r.n.; simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Vitamin E 400 U p.o. q.d.;
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.; allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Naprosyn , which causes renal
dysfunction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a history of four packs per day for 20
years and quit years ago. No alcohol or other
drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a sister status post CABG.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temp 97.8 , heart rate 67 , BP
146/98 , satting 95% on two liters. GENERAL:
This is an Asian male in no apparent distress. HEENT: His eyes
were anicteric , PERRL , EOMI. Oropharynx showed moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP approximately 10-11 cm of water , with no
bruit. HEART: He had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur in the
right and left upper sternal border , and positive S4 , no S3.
LUNGS: Rales 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up on the left side. The right
was clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Obese. He had bowel sounds
and no masses. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. He
had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray was a poor film. It was an AP done
only. It showed no obvious infiltrates. EKG
showed sinus brady- , with first degree AV block and no acute ST or
T-wave changes. Laboratories on admission showed a BUN and
creatinine of 9 and 1.4. White count 6.37 , hematocrit 43 ,
platelet count 146. CK 90 , troponin-I 0.06. His protein was 12.3 ,
INR 1.1 , PTT 32.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Uyeda.</PHI> was subsequently admitted for R/O MI , and
unstable angina. The patient was did R/O for MI
by EKG and enzymes. He was heparinized and continued on all of his
medications that he presented on , and he was also continued on
nitropaste sliding scale to keep him pain free.
On hospital day #1 , the nitropaste was taken off , given that the
patient had a headache. In the evening , however , the cross-cover
intern was called as the patient developed 4 out of 10 chest pain
with deep breathing , which the patient stated felt like his typical
angina. Therefore , the nitropaste was restarted and the patient
was pain free within approximately two minutes.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on hospital day #2 , which
showed an EF of 60-65% , 1+ MR , and borderline inferior hypokinesis.
He had an ETT MIBI done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/3/14.</PHI> He exercise approximately 9
minutes and 45 seconds and stopped secondary to his chest pain and
fatigue. His peak heart rate was 89 , and BP 170/98. He had
horizontal downsloping of 1 mm , ST depression in the inferior leads
and V5-V6 , which was persistent in recovery. He got one sublingual
nitroglycerin given. On the images , it showed: ( 1 ) Moderate to
severe ischemia of the inferior wall and the posterior septum ( RCA )
7 out of 20 segments; ( 2 ) Mild ischemia of the anterior wall and
septum ( LAD ) 4 out of 20 segments; ( 3 ) An EF of 59%. The patient
was continued on heparin , nitropaste , and aspirin , and was sent for
cardiac catheterization on hospital day #3. Cardiac
catheterization showed: ( 1 ) A left main which was okay;
( 2 ) Totally occluded RCA; ( 3 ) Totally occluded LAD after the D1;
( 4 ) His left circ was 30-40% with a mid instant occlusion; ( 5 ) LIMA
to LAD was patent; ( 6 ) A treated LIMA , gaze TNG arrow patent;
( 7 ) Status post RIMA PTCA/stenting with significant spasm of the
entire RIMA. The patient , therefore , had a LIMA to PTCA stenting
performed and underwent some vasospasm on cardiac catheterization.
However , he was given Isordil and nifedipine for the spasm , which
resolved. The patient was in stable condition and pain free after
the catheterization and did not develop any complications such as a
hematoma or otherwise.
The patient was discharged to his home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/05/14</PHI> in stable
condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d.; ECASA 325 mg
p.o. q.d.; Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nifedipine

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/27/2917</PHI>
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: LEFT HIP FRACTURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. FAT EMBOLI SYNDROME.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. DECUBITUS ULCERS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">NIMQC</PHI> is a 68-year-old man who
came in with a chief complaint of hip
pain after a mechanical fall. The patient had been hospitalized in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">6/05</PHI> for ischemic right toes requiring debridement and amputation.
At that time , his hospital course was complicated by a non-Q wave
MI. Cardiology have recommended medical management with Lopressor
at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
45%. Dobutamine MIBI revealed a severe fixed perfusion defect in
the inferoposterior and inferoseptal left ventricle without any
peri-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction by MIBI imaging was 26%
in contrast to the echo results. The patient was ultimately
discharged on Lopressor , however , she stopped taking the Lopressor
for unclear reasons. For the few months prior to admission , he
developed increasing dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and increasing pedal edema , as well as nocturia , however ,
denied any orthopnea , any chest pain , fevers , melena , bright red
blood per rectum or palpitations. A few days prior to admission ,
the patient developed a dry cough and some rhinorrhea.
On the morning of admission , the patient sustained a mechanical
fall while trying to retrieve a newspaper. He had no
light-headedness , palpitations , pain in his chest , nausea or
vomiting , sweating or change in vision or sensory symptoms prior to
or after the fall. The patient fell onto his left side and
immediately developed left-sided leg and hip pain for which she
presented to the emergency room at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy
( ischemic ) , peripheral vascular disease ,
status post amputation of right-sided toes , status post right
femoral to PT avascularization , diabetes type II , status post CVA ,
hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. , Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , glyburide 5 mg
p.o. q.d. , multivitamins , cough medicine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Aminoglycosides , unknown reaction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking one pack per
day x40 years , quit five years prior to admission.
He has one drink of liquor per day , lives at home alone in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</PHI> , and is in the insurance business.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother died of cancer at 74. Father
died at 55 of heart disease. Mother died at 50 of
a heart attack.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile , temperature 97.3 ,
heart rate 106 , blood pressure 162/77 ,
oxygenation 94% on room air. GENERAL: He was alert and oriented.
LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. PELVIS: Stable.
His left lower extremity had well-healed scars from donor site for
bypass grafting , strong dopplerable PT and DP pulses. His left leg
was externally rotated. Sensation was intact to light touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarb
19 , BUN 56 , creatinine 2.5. White count 12 ,
hematocrit 33 , platelets 388. PTT 40.5 , INR 1.2. EKG showed sinus
tach at 102 , with occasional PVCs , normal axis , normal intervals ,
no evidence of ischemia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary
edema. X-rays of his left pelvis and femur revealed fracture of
the left intertrochanter and subtrochanteric fracture with lesser
trochanteric fracture intact by 3 cm , less than five degrees
angulation. His femoral head was reduced.
IMPRESSION: A 68-year-old man with significant cardiac history
and vascular disease , status post left hip fracture
with mechanical fall , with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - Initially , the patient was
to be admitted to the orthopedic service with
medicine consult for wrist stratification. However , the patient
was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and
management. The patient was noted to have a troponin leak although
CK enzymes remained negative for ischemia. He had a MIBI performed
which revealed an unchanged fixed defect. He remained in sinus
tach with occasional PVCs and runs of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia lasting 3-4 beats at a time throughout his admission.
Sinus tach was attributed pain and discomfort , possibly with
element of hypoxia contributing as well. A troponin leak was
attributed to strain particularly in the setting of his
tachycardia. He was started on beta blocker , Ace inhibitor and
continued on an aspirin. He was aggressively diuresed with
afterload reduction. He was titrated upward as noted.
2. Pulmonary - The patient's crackles persisted on lung exam after
aggressive diuresis , prompting performance of a chest CT which
revealed an interstitial pattern with peripheral nodularity
consistent with fat emboli syndrome , positive component of
congestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia as well. The
patient was continued on a regimen of Lasix for diuresis and was
treated for aspiration pneumonia as noted below. His oxygen
requirement diminished over a few days and he was maintained on two
liters of nasal cannula oxygen at the time of transfer to rehab.
3. Renal - The patient developed some renal failure in the setting
of diuresis , which improved with hydration. The patient
subsequently tolerated further diuresis with improvement in his
creatinine and it is possible that renal failure is due to fat
emboli syndrome as well and should improve slowly.
4. ID - The patient was treated with vancomycin , Flagyl and
levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia , course completed
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/26/17.</PHI> The patient remained afebrile. His white blood count on
admission and discharge was 12.
5. Neurologically - The patient apparently had baseline mild
perfusion. The possibly worsened due to the fat embolic syndrome
and was at baseline prior to discharge per the patient's daughter.
6. Heme - The patient was continued on Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d.
for prophylaxis against DVT post-hip surgery to continue for six
months minimal followed by orthopedic surgery.
7. GI - The patient developed some diarrhea. C. diff. cultures
were negative to date at the time of discharge. The patient was
maintained on Nexium prophylaxis in the setting of his
anticoagulation.
8. Endocrine - The patient was restarted on oral hypoglycemics
prior to discharge in addition to sliding scale insulin. The
patient had a Foley and a triple lumen catheter , both of which were
removed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/26/17.</PHI> The patient was evaluated by plastic surgery
for his peripheral vascular disease with ulcers. Recommended dry
sterile dressings to the right and left foot wound changed q.d.
with DuoDerm to the left lower leg wound to be changed q.3 days ,
with pressure sore prevention.
9. FEN - The patient was discharged on standing 20 mEq of K-Dur
q.d. It is likely to be checked q.o.d. to monitor for any further
requirements particularly in the setting of his runs of
nonsustained V-tach as noted above.
10. Ortho - The patient is followed daily by orthopedic surgery
and was discharged with staples on his left lower extremities to be
discontinued per orthopedic surgery recommendations in the future.
11. Disposition - The patient was stable for discharge to rehab on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/27/17.</PHI> He was to follow up with his primary care physician ,
orthopedic surgery , cardiology , and pulmonary medicine within the
next two weeks. His labs are to be drawn for a metabolic panel ,
magnesium and calcium q.o.d. for as long as the primary care
physician feels it is necessary with repletion of his electrolytes
as needed. He is to have physical therapy performed as needed.
His weightbearing status is non-weightbearing on the left lower
extremity and weightbearing as tolerated on his right lower
extremity per orthopedic surgery at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE DIET: ADA diet , low fat , low cholesterol , low salt.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS
SURGERY IN 1988.
2 ) ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE SINCE 1983.
3 ) INFERIOR WALL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man with
a history of ischemic heart disease
since 1983. He had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at this time
and in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and a
subsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. In 1991 , he
sustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantine
thallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. He was
well maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1992.
At this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstable
angina. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time.
An echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.
Persantine thallium in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1995 demonstrated posterobasilar
defect with 60% redistribution. After this episode , he had again
been symptom free. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/25/10</PHI> , the patient began experiencing
substernal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left arm
with good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episode
time of five minutes. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/26/10</PHI> , he had a similar episode for
approximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. On the day of
admission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode of
substernal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea.
EKG was significant only for non-specific low T waves. Patient was
heparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin and
nitrates. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and the
plan was to do a persantine thallium. The patient continued to
have pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further evaluation and cardiac
catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above as well as significant for polio
with subsequent muscle weakness of the left
hip and leg.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission were notable for Lopressor 50 mg
q.6h. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , and
Heparin 1300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission were notable for a
blood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heart
rate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was no
jugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs were
clear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point of
maximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm ,
normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. Abdomen was
soft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly ,
extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit
of 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassium
of 3.7 , PT and PTT of 12.7 and 55 with an INR of 1.1 , and
cholesterol was noted to be 287.
HOSPITAL COURSE: While here , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JXGDSZ</PHI> had one episode of 10/10
substernal chest pressure not associated with
diaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin. EKG with pain as compared to old EKG demonstrated
inversion of T waves in V1 through V3 and questionable inversions
in III and F. These inversions were present on a <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/27/10</PHI> EKG but
not on a <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/28/10</PHI> EKG. The EKG changes with the past medical
history was most likely significant of ongoing instability of the
patient's anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. At this
time , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. This is a 57 year
old male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the
past status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988
admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest.
Aspirin , Heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued.
Cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vessel
disease but the bypass grafts , the LIMA to the left anterior
descending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramus
was occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graft
to the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to the
patient's pain and EKG changes. The patient was continued on
Heparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemed
appropriate to PTCA the ramus lesion. The patient was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/3/10</PHI> for successful PTCA of the
ramus occlusion. Post-procedure , the patient was stable and chest
pain free. Post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with a
blood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. The right femoral
catheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulses
were 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and there
was no cyanosis. The patient was enrolled on the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">IL155</PHI> protocol as
per Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Elmo.</PHI> and as such , received 36 hours of intravenous
protocol therapy post-catheterization. The right groin sheaths
were removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 ,
and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint of
chest pain. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital
day. Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of
130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 ,
O2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normal
limits. Cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensity
non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs.
DISPOSITION: The patient is stable upon discharge and symptom
free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. and
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Irmgard Nixon</PHI> at
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Arline-Alfredo Conrad Ibrahim Harry.</PHI>

ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Higgins , Estela Hahn</PHI> MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Non-ST elevation , acute
myocardial infarction , and acute renal failure. She was
transferred from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bush Ibrahim Healthcare</PHI> to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old lady with
diabetes and known coronary artery disease status post CABG and
status post multiple PCIs. She was in her usual state of health
until three weeks ago when she began with classical paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. She was taken to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bush Ibrahim Healthcare</PHI> on
three different occasions in the past three weeks prior to
admission , where she was treated for pulmonary edema. Prior to
her admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> , she had had a
troponin leak of up to 3.6. This was on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">15th or 16th of October</PHI> . She also was admitted with acute renal failure. Her
creatinine on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">19th of October</PHI> per note was 1.1. When we
admitted her creatinine was 2.6. This was likely secondary to
the fact that she had received amikacin for urinary tract
infection at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bush Ibrahim Healthcare</PHI> and she had also had a
chest , abdominal , and pelvis contrast CT leading to contrast
nephropathy. When she was admitted , her main problems were the
following: She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
She was a high-risk patient with a TIMI score of 5. She had
acute renal failure probably secondary to a number of factors
including contrast dye what she had received at the outside
hospital and amikacin which she had received for urinary tract
infection. Her other problem was she had a urinary tract
infection per report secondary to E. Coli resistant to Levaquin
and gentamicin.
Her past medical history was relevant for the following:
She had diabetes type 2 with chronic renal insufficiency
secondary to the diabetes. She has anxiety disorder. She had
coronary artery disease status post CABG in 1992. She is status
post PCI with a stent placed in 2002 , and 2004 apparently. She
also had congestive heart failure with an EF per an echo
performed at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bush Ibrahim Healthcare</PHI> was 35%. She had GERD and
Barrett's esophagus. She had hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia. She had had a pacemaker placed. She had
hemorrhoids. She had osteoarthritis with both knees. She had
spinal stenosis and chronic back pain status post cholecystectomy
and a history of asthma.
Her allergies included the following: Bactrim , penicillin ,
erythromycin , Keflex , Metformin , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin.
Her social history , she was in a nursing facility. She is
divorced. She has four kinds. Lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</PHI> and is often
visited by her children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her temperature was 96 , her
pulse 77 , her blood pressure was 170/95 , although admittedly it
was difficult taking her blood pressure by auscultation. This
was measured by palpation and confirmed by Doppler. She was
satting 96% on 3.5 L via nasal cannula. She is alert and
oriented x3 in no acute distress. She had arcus senilis. Her
extraocular movements are intact. She had pupils equal , round ,
and reactive to light. Her chest showed bibasilar crackles/rales
two-thirds way up. Her JVP is 10 cm water. Her heart had a
regular rate and rhythm with no gallop. No rubs or murmurs
heard. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm with no
edema and she is grossly neurologically intact.
Her first set of labs at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI>
revealed the following: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 ,
CO2 24 , BUN 40 , creatinine 2.5 , glucose 95 , white blood cell
count of 10.16 , a hemoglobin of 10.0 , platelets 232 , INR 1.5.
Her BNP was 2138. Her lipase was 7. Her troponin level was
0.75.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction. On presentation ,
the patient had several EKG changes consistent with an acute
coronary syndrome. She was in normal sinus rhythm with T wave
flattening or inversion in leads V4 to V6 and in the inferior
leads also 2 , 3 , aVF. She had Q-S complexes in V1 through V3.
She was deemed to be a high-risk patient for the TIMI score of
5and they documented troponin leak. She was managed medically ,
not interventionally given her acute renal failure. She was
treated with unfractionated heparin with a PTT level of 50 to 70
seconds. She was given aspirin , Plavix. She was also given
eptifibatide intravenously for five days and is also treated with
beta blockers and ACE inhibitor. After five days , she had no
recurrent chest pain. Her EKG changes were persistent but her
troponin levels have trended downwards and she has really been
asymptomatic in this regard. Regarding her pulmonary edema , we
treated with Lasix initially 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and then on
standing PO Lasix 40 mg daily , and diuresed her and also gave her
morphine and oxygen. Within four or five days , her physical
examination was much better and her crackles and rales had
markedly decreased. On admission , she was saturating 96% on 3.5
L. She progressed. Her oxygen requirements decreased. She was
diuresed and was finally weaned off oxygen and is currently
saturating 97% on room air. The plan is for her to continue on
aspirin , Plavix , high-dose Lipitor , and beta-blocker , and
nitrates as needed.
2. In terms of her acute renal failure , based on the records
from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bush Ibrahim Healthcare</PHI> , her creatinine had jumped from
1.1 to 2.5 in three days. This was felt to be most likely due to
intrinsic renal failure. She did not have a low urine output and
she had received amikacin in the past few days prior to admission
as well as contrast dye and she did have a history of contrast
dye induced nephropathy leading to a predialysis state , although
she did not get dialysis on that occasion. Here , we simply
avoided nephrotoxic agents , were judicious in the use of Lasix
with strict ??____?? controls , and her creatinine gradually began
to decrease and today it is down to 1.6. Infectious Disease
wise , she came with the documented urinary tract infection
reported to be due to E. coli resistant to levofloxacin and
gentamicin. Here , we cultured her again and found E. coli more
than a 100 , 000 colonies , which was resistant to ampicillin ,
gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , and levofloxacin. It was sensitive to
ceftazidime and she therefore received renally dosed ceftazidime
for her UTI to complete a 7 to 10-day course. Blood cultures
drawn on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">22nd of October</PHI> showed no growth to date. The
patient has also been afebrile in with a white blood cell count
between 7 and 11 , 000. In terms of her hypertension , of note , it
has been difficult to measure her blood pressure , probably
measuring her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation is a
most reliable way to do this. She was treated here with
hydralazine , Lopressor , and diuretics. On discharge , she feels
well. Today , she told me that she has not filled this for a long
time. She had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.
She is afebrile with a temperature of 98. Her pulse ranges
between 60 and 70. Her blood pressure is between 102 and 150
systolic and she is satting 95% on room air. Her current weight
is 73 kg and she is deemed to be euvolemic so this should be her
target weight and she is ambulating with assistance. She is
alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress. She has got pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light. She has only a few
bibasilar crackles on bases. Otherwise , her lungs are clear.
Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no gallops , rubs , or
murmurs. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm. Her
right calf is quite tender to palpation. She has a documented
old DVT in her gastrocnemius vein. This is old and she has
probably got some postphlebitic syndrome and should be followed.
She is neurologically grossly intact.
Her laboratories at discharge include the following:
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.7 , her creatinine is 1.6 , BUN is 50 , her
white blood cell count is 11.01 , hematocrit 28.5 , hemoglobin 9.2 ,
and platelets 258 with an INR of 1.2.
Her medications at discharge include the following:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg orally daily.
2. Ceftazidime 1 g IV q.24h. until <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 31st</PHI> to complete a
7-day course.
3. Colace 100 mg orally twice a day in case of constipation.
4. Lasix 40 mg orally every 12 hours.
5. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day , while
the patient is bedridden.
6. Isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg orally three times a day.
7. Lopressor 37.5 mg orally three times a day with hold
parameters , hold if systolic blood pressure is less than 110 , or
a heart rate is less than 55.
8. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.
9. Vicodin one tablet every six hours in case of pain.
10. Risperidone 0.5 mg orally once a day.
11. Lipitor 80 mg orally once a day.
12. Plavix 75 mg orally once a day.
13. Celexa 20 mg orally once a day.
14. Esomeprazole 20 mg orally once a day.
15. Lantus 17 units subcutaneously every morning.
16. Novolog sliding scale.
DISPOSITION AND PLAN: The patient is to go to rehabilitation.
Things to do specifically include the following:
She should be diuresed with Lasix as needed to achieve a dry
weight goal of 72 kg. She should continue on ceftazidime for her
urinary tract infection until <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 31st</PHI> and her calf pain -
DVT should be followed , one possibly to raise the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bush Ibrahim Healthcare</PHI> as this may represent in a cold malignancy , for which she
may need to be worked up once the acute setting is over.
Studies performed at this hospital include the following:
A renal ultrasound as part of her workup for acute renal failure
reveal a right kidney with a size of 11.8 cm and apical cortical
cyst , left kidney 10.6 cm , and no hydronephrosis. The patient
also had a MIBI , SPECT of her heart , which revealed the
following:
The combined ??____?? ischemia plus scar during the stress were
moderately abnormal with a summed stress score of 9. Her rest LV
ejection fraction was 50%. The patient's PET CT test results
were normal and consistent with a small region of myocardial
ischemia in the septal area and also a focus of ischemia in the
OM territory. She had abnormal global LV systolic function and
these results demonstrated in interval progressing per her prior
study performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 5</PHI> , 2004.

creatinine 1.1 , glucose 67 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit
36 , platelets 222 , PT 17 , INR 2.3 , PTT 32. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with no acute changes noted. Chest x-ray showed mild
cardiomegaly , no congestive heart failure or infiltrate. Head CT
showed movement artifact with no obvious CVA , ? hypodensity in the
right upper pons but likely artifact.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with symptoms of
vertical diplopia and unsteadiness/imbalance ,
falling to the left , with improvement overnight. Patient still had
an abduction defect with her right eye on the morning after
admission and mild leftward gait unsteadiness , but her vertical
diplopia had resolved. The patient was continued to be monitored.
Her blood pressure was followed. Patient was kept on Coumadin.
Patient was scheduled for an open air MRI , given her significant
size. Patient was scheduled for an open MRI at the MRI in
<PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</PHI> On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-6-13</PHI> , patient underwent MRI with particular
interest in visualization of the posterior fossa. No acute infarct
or hemorrhage was noted on MRI MRA. The patient was continued on
her Coumadin. Coumadin had been increased from admission dose of
17 mg to 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. Initially , her INR went down slightly
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-6-13</PHI> to 1.7 , likely secondary to a missed dose earlier in the
week. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-7-13</PHI> , patient reported feeling back to her baseline of
one week ago. Patient denied any new symptoms. Patient denied
further imbalance or vertical diplopia. Patient was thought to
have had a likely small vessel cerebral infarct and , although no
stroke was demonstrated on MRI , involvement of patient's left side
suggested a cerebral lesion in the brain stem in order to explain
the diplopia. Patient probably had a very small vessel stroke/TIA.
Patient has known major risk factors for both small vessel and
large vessel and cardioembolic disease. Patient was discharged to
continue further risk factor modification in the outpatient clinic.
Patient is to continue her cardiac medical regimen. Patient will
continue with Coumadin for a goal INR of 2-3 for her chronic atrial
fibrillation. Patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-7-13.</PHI> She was
instructed to call <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> on Monday morning to schedule an
appointment with her primary care physician within the next 10
days. Patient is discharged in stable condition.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: PNEUMONIA , RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
( MI ).
CHIEF COMPLAINT: CHEST PAIN AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male
with a history of hypertension , LVH ,
and heroin use , who presented with shortness of breath times
several weeks which was sometimes associated with chest pain. The
patient noted that the shortness of breath was often brought on by
heroin use ( He has not used cocaine for several years. His last
heroin use was the day prior to admission. ). His shortness of
breath was "off and on , " worse with exertion. It was not
necessarily worse when lying flat. He has had this shortness of
breath for several months , although as mentioned , was worse in the
weeks prior to admission. His chest pain was hard for him to
describe , although , he did mention that it was not heavy in
character. He admitted to some chest discomfort when he became
excited or agitated. He also described his chest pain as sharp.
There was no nausea. He did complain of some dizziness. His pain
did not radiate to the neck or arms and was different from
heartburn pain. Of note , the patient has not taken his outpatient
medications for the last six months and admits to diet
noncompliance with salty foods. The patient's last heroin use , as
mentioned , was the day prior to admission. In the past , he has
noticed that he cannot go more than two days without symptoms of
withdrawal.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for constipation for which he takes
laxatives. There is no abdominal pain.
Occasional headache. No change in vision. No dysuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Remarkable for IV drug abuse - heroin
currently , cocaine in the past.
2. Hypertension times many years. 3. Gout. 4. Left ventricular
hypertrophy.
MEDICATIONS: The patient has taken no medications for six months.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</PHI> with his
brother and his sister. He is on disability since
1992. He smokes one pack every 3 days. He rarely uses alcohol.
He does use IV drugs as mentioned.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.3 , heart rate 95. Upon
presentation to the emergency room , his
blood pressure was 190/110 , respiratory rate 24 , O2 sat 100% on two
liters. GENERAL: The patient was seated and in no acute distress.
HEENT: Conjunctiva was slightly pink but nonicteric. Extraocular
muscles are intact. Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to
light. He had poor dentition. His JVP was 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation on the left. On the right there were some crackles
midway up the lung field. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with a
normal S1 , S2. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Markedly hypoactive bowel sounds. His belly was soft and
obese , nontender. There were no obvious masses. EXTREMITIES: The
patient had 2+ pulses. There was no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
NEUROLOGIC: The patient was alert and oriented x 3. Neural exam
was otherwise nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 141 , potassium 3.4 , chloride
106 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine
2.1 , glucose 107 , calcium 8.4. CK was 158 with an MB of 2.2 ,
troponin was 0.12. Toxicology screen was negative. Urine
toxicology was positive for opiates. Urinalysis was remarkable for
1+ blood and 3+ protein. CBC white count was 6.9 , hematocrit 45.7 ,
platelets 301 , 000. PT was 13.2 , PTT 32.6 , INR 1.0.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a right pleural effusion and a
right middle lobe pneumonia. EKG on arrival to the emergency room
showed an irregular ventricular rate at 156 which was likely atrial
fibrillation vs flutter. There was a normal axis. There were
T wave inversions in the inferior leads as well as V5 and V6. The
EKG was then repeated after the patient had received diltiazem
which showed sinus rhythm at 86. There were still T wave
inversions in AVL and V6. There was borderline first-degree AV
block. There was LVH and T waves were flat inferiorly.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular - ischemia. The
patient ruled out for MI by CKs but
had a troponin which peaked at 0.12. This was thought to be rate
related. Blood pressure control was established with verapamil
( The patient had severe bronchospasms to Lopressor and it was
unclear whether it was cardiac asthma or real bronchospastic
reaction. ) , clonidine , and losartan. ( The patient had cough and
desaturation to captopril. ) Aspirin was given. A lipid panel was
checked and showed a total cholesterol of 188 , LDL 130 , HDL 56 and
triglycerides of 63. The patient was initially continued on
simvastatin. Because of the worry of CHF , ( History of low EF ,
possible orthopnea ) an echocardiogram was performed which showed
LVEF only 25% with global hypokinesis and inferior/posterior
akinesis. The etiology of his heart failure was unclear as he had
never had a known myocardial infarction in the past. A chemical
stress test was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 1</PHI> , 2003 , and showed no
reversible defect but a large inferior scar. The patient was
subsequently taken to cardiac catheterization to determine whether
he had coronary artery disease. There was no coronary artery
disease on left heart cath. Right heart cath showed an elevated
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure close to 30 and a central venous
pressure of 18. His cardiomyopathy was not shown to be ischemic in
origin. There was no indication seen for AICD placement. However ,
for the elevated central pressures , the patient was aggressively
diuresed with IV Lasix which was then changed to p.o. torsemide.
Aspirin and simvastatin were discontinued given lack of coronary
artery disease for the sake of simplifying his medical regimen in
order to optimize the chance of medical compliance.
2. Pulmonary. The patient was given levofloxacin for
community-acquired pneumonia and improved. On the evening of
admission , he had a severe bronchospastic reaction to Lopressor so
this was discontinued. He received nebulizers around the clock for
recurrent wheeze and cough. It was noted that the onset of his
cough was after his captopril dosing. For this reason , captopril
was discontinued and changed to losartan which he tolerated well
and with resolution of his cough.
3. Renal. The patient's creatinine was noted to be up to the
mid-2s from a baseline in the mid-1s. Potential etiologies on
admission where thought to be hypertension , gout , heroin use or a
low flow during his cardiac arrhythmia on presentation. A phenol
was calculated and was shown to be less than 1%. A 24-hour protein
was performed and showed over 3 gm of protein. The most likely
cause of this proteinuria was thought to be CHF , although , the
patient should have renal follow up. The patient refused Mucomyst
in anticipation of his cardiac catheterization. He underwent a
renal ultrasound which showed increased echogenicity of both
kidneys which was consistent with medical renal disease. There was
no hydronephrosis seen. There were bilateral renal cysts and a
right renal calculus. The patient will be seen in follow up with
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">SCNTI</PHI> of renal.
4. Heroin addiction. The <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">*Wilda</PHI> team was consulted for heroin
addiction. Methadone was given and was tapered to off during his
admission.
5. Other. Allopurinol was given for his history of gout.
6. Prophylaxis. The patient was kept on subcu heparin.
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Junior , Venita Garry</PHI> , his primary care
doctor , on Tuesday , <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 8</PHI> , 2003 , at 8:00 AM and with
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">SCNTI</PHI> of renal on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 17</PHI> , 2003 , at 1:30 PM.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q day , losartan
100 mg p.o. q day , albuterol inhaler two
puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. wheeze , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q day and

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND
MIXED MITRAL VALVE DISEASE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HMSGM</PHI> is an 87 year-old
woman with a history of coronary
artery disease , mitral regurgitation and multiple sclerosis. She
has been complaining of chest pain and pressure on exertion as well
as dyspnea on exertion associated with limitation of activity and
increasing sublingual nitroglycerin use for the six to seven months
prior to admission. Of note , the patient developed atrial
fibrillation , atrial flutter back in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> , 1995. An
echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an ejection fraction of
40% , inferior hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and a
left atrial size of 6.1 centimeters. The patient required
hospitalization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1996 , for congestive heart failure. She
returned to the hospital in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> , 1996 , with complaints of chest
pain at rest and shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Demarcus Carmine .</PHI> and transferred to
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> , where she refused cardiac
catheterization. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45% , inferior , posterior and anterior septal
hypokinesis , mild to moderate mitral stenosis and moderate mitral
regurgitation. Again , there was left atrial enlargement measured
at 6.1 centimeters. The patient returned home and was doing well
until <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 3</PHI> , 1996 , when she developed headache , chest pain and
shortness of breath. She again presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Demarcus Carmine .</PHI> where
she was found to be in acute pulmonary edema. She was stabilized
and transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further
management.

transfer , the patient was also on intravenous heparin and
Nitropaste.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and retired. She has no smoking
or alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in atrial fibrillation at a rate of
83. Her blood pressure is 100/60 and is 95%
on room air. HEENT: Significant for upper and lower dentures
without any oropharyngeal lesions. NECK: Supple with 2+ carotid
pulses and no bruits. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. III/VI
holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis , clubbing
or edema. There are varicosities in bilateral lower extremities
with minimal varicosities over the thigh areas. There is bilateral
knee swelling. Pedal pulses are 1+ bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL:
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN is 35 , creatinine 1.5. White blood cell count
8.3. Hematocrit 32. PT 11.9 , PTT 28.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> Cardiology Service , where she
was maximized medically. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 8</PHI> , 1996 , where she was noted to have
right coronary artery stenosis in the mid portion which was 50% and
distally had 80%. Finally , 90% with subtotal occlusion after the
posterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery
had 40% stenosis after diagonal 1. Diagonal 1 itself had 90%
stenosis in the mid portion. The left circumflex had a 70%
stenosis at the mid portion and another 70% stenotic area at the
distal portion. Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated
at 45%. Inferior hypokinesis was noted as was 3-4+ mitral
regurgitation. Right atrial pressures were 6 , right ventricle was
52/10 , pulmonary artery 52/22 , with mean of 33 , pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 27 and left ventricle was 160/16. The patient
was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service for coronary artery
bypass grafting and replacement of her mitral valve. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 12</PHI> , 1996 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal one , saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending artery , diagonal one and to left anterior descending
artery. She also had mitral valve replacement with 31 millimeter
Hancock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred postoperatively to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on
nitroglycerin , Dopamine drip. She was weaned to extubate without
difficulty. She was restarted on Captopril and digoxin as well as
Coumadin. The patient had minimal response to diuretics ,
associated with a rise in her creatinine to 1.9. The Captopril was
discontinued and the creatinine returned again to 1.3. Although
the chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions , the
patient did not require aggressive diuresis initially as she had
excellent oxygenation on room air. Of note the patient was not
restarted on Lopressor as her blood pressures remained in the
90-100 range. The patient was , however , started on her prednisone
at 5 milligrams p.o. q.d. as well as on her Synthroid. Chest tubes
and invasive monitoring were discontinued early in the patient's
hospital course and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four. The patient was followed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy for progression of her
mobility. She was determined to benefit from intensive
rehabilitation at a facility.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was ambulating with
assistance. She was tolerating a regular
diet. She was seen to be in atrial fibrillation but ventricular
response was well controlled in the 60s to 70s. Of note , her
electrocardiogram demonstrated persistent right bundle branch block
as well as a left anterior fascicular block. Although the patient
had been receiving more than her normal doses of Coumadin , her INR
had not reached the therapeutic range. She was , however ,
therapeutic on heparin.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to a facility for
intensive conditioning and rehabilitation. There she
will continue to receive her heparin until she is therapeutic on
her Coumadin. Coumadin dosing will be handled by primary care
doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yzaguirre Lena</PHI> , or a physician at the rehabilitation
center. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yzaguirre Lena</PHI> 's number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">935-875-3720.</PHI> The goal INR is 2
to 2.5. The patient will also require follow-up chest x-rays as
prior to discharge , her chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions which were small and were not compromising her
respiration at all.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; digoxin 0.125 milligrams p.o.
q.d.; Colace 100 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. while taking Tylenol #3;
Lasix 80 milligrams p.o. q.d. to be continued initially but may be
discontinued at the discretion of the primary care or cardiology
physicians , pending the resolution of the pleural effusions and her
respiratory status; Synthroid 150 micrograms p.o. q.d. The patient
will require thyroid function tests in four weeks. Multivitamin
one tablet p.o. q.d.; Coumadin , dose to be determined by the
patient's INR , again the goal is 2 to 2.5. The patient received 4
milligrams on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 18</PHI> , and 3 milligrams on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 19</PHI> , and her
INR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 19</PHI> is 1.3. Axid 150 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; K-Dur
10 mEq p.o. q.d. , potassium will also need to be monitored while
she is on the Lasix; intravenous heparin 800 units per hour with a
PTT goal of 50-60. The patient's PTT today on this dosing is 54.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient should follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTXESG</PHI> in four to
six weeks , with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">UMUUZ</PHI> in two weeks , and with Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yzaguirre Lena</PHI> in one to two weeks.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 61 year old female with
coronary artery disease ( status post
PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who
presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of
inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker
placement. Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JMQQT</PHI> 's pertinent medical history was significant
for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery
disease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional
chest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance
test was performed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/07</PHI> which was standard Bruce protocol at
six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and
maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST
depression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/07</PHI>
revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid right
coronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-right
collaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20%
residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then
re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/07</PHI> revealed
an ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent with
prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen.
Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery ) was performed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/07</PHI> ( Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTXESG</PHI> ). Since
then , she had done well with no further chest pain. Starting
approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to
experience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of the
sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and
diaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had never
actually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , she
frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis.
She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but
did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only
when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 24</PHI> , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. The
patient's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) was
discontinued , however , repeat Holter on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16/11</PHI> revealed multiple
pauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting
4.2 seconds. The patient was then sent to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further evaluation and management.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/05/2919</PHI>
ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Utterback Yannone Naomi</PHI> MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , the patient is a
76-year-old woman with coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 who was recently admitted
with non ST elevation MI/congestive heart failure at which time
catheterization revealed an increased wedge with decreased
patency in both venous grafts and a patent LIMA graft with
collaterals. The patient has an extensive past medical history
of hypercholesterolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , insulin
dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease status post multiple
MI , CABG , hypertension , degenerative joint disease , CVA , gout ,
schizoaffective disorder , tardive dyskinesia and hypothyroidism.
At her baseline she has been staying at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanhorn Harper Gabriela.</PHI> and on
admission was complaining of chest pressure since waking , similar
to the pressure she felt during a prior admission. She had a
certain amount of shortness of breath , some nausea , two episodes
of vomiting and her symptoms were not responsive to nitroglycerin
tablets at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanhorn Harper Gabriela.</PHI> The patient came to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> Emergency Department where she reported that her
chest pressure had resolved. She was treated with IV TNG. In
the Emergency Department she was also treated with Lopressor ,
aspirin , IV trinitroglycerin and was heparinized. The patient
then pulled out the lines. Her admission vitals were significant
for a blood pressure of 180/90. The patient had a heart rate of
86 , was afebrile and was breathing at 100% at 2 liters. She had
an elevated JVP , had clear sounding lungs , trace edema and at the
left upper sternal border and left lower sternal border a
systolic ejection murmur II-III/VI was heard with S1 and S2.
Admission labs were significant for an elevated creatinine of
2.0. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient had elevated
platelets from a baseline of 30 to 80 to 673 on admission , a
white count of 9.3 , hematocrit of 35. EKG was notable for a Q3
which had been seen on a prior EKG. T-wave inversions also seen
on a prior EKG. The patient had an echo on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/15</PHI> which showed
concentric LVH with an EF of 30-35% , posterolateral and inferior
akinesis was also seen. A calcified aortic valve with trace AI
and mild MR was seen. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/14</PHI> , the patient had catheterization
which showed that her circulation was right dominant with an LAD
90% and 100% lesions , left circumflex with 100% lesion , RCA with
100% lesions. She had an SVG to PDA graft with 100% lesion , SVG
to circumflex graft with 85% lesion stented to 10% at that time.
She had a LIMA to LAD graft which was patent , and she had lots of
collaterals. The right heart cath was significant for a wedge of
39 and a PA of 75/34 and right atrial pressure of 14 and a
cardiac index of 1.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system ,
1. Ischemia: The patient was initially treated with aspirin ,
beta blockers , statin , Plavix , Heparinized and was ruled out with
enzymes. On the first day of hospitalizations , the patient's
heparin was stopped , the patient's IV trinitroglycerin was
stopped as well. The patient was started on nadolol and that
dose was increased to 80 q.day which the patient tolerated well
and seemed to control the patient's blood pressure and heart rate
reasonably well. The patient's attending felt that the patient
was a poor candidate for catheterization and other interventions
and would not benefit significantly from it. The symptoms the
patient was having was similar she was having during a prior
hospitalization which had ended just two days before this
admission. It was felt that her nausea , vomiting and chest
pressure were probably noncardiac in nature. The only change in
the patient's cardiac medications at the time of discharge is an
increase in nadolol to 80 mg q.day.
Rhythm: The patient's rhythm was monitored on telemetry for most
of her stay during this hospitalization. Significant events were
not observed.
Pump: The patient was continued at her regular dose of
outpatient medications which seemed to be effective. The patient
had multiple complaints of chest pain/pressure during her
hospitalization which resulted in periodic examinations and EKGs.
All of these workups were negative.
2. GI: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/28</PHI> it was noted that the patient had an increased
white count of 16 , 000. Also on exam on that day it was noted
that the patient had marked right upper quadrant abdominal
tenderness and fullness. She was not tender anywhere else in her
abdomen. Abdominal exam was also significant for a central mass
representing an umbilical hernia. At that time , General Surgery
consult was called. Lipase and amylase were sent off. They were
negative. Liver function tests were also in the normal range at
that time. Surgery felt that the patient was a poor surgical
candidate given her comorbidities at that time but did recommend
a cholecystectomy in the future. They recommended initial
antibiotic course of amp , Levo and Flagyl which she was started
on. They also recommended making the patient NPO treated her
with Pepcid and giving her adequate IV hydration. The major
intervention they suggested was a cholecystectomy tube by
Interventional Radiology which was placed on the night of
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8/28/19.</PHI> On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/29</PHI> , the patient's white count was down to 10 with
a Tmax of 100 , and at the time of discharge the patient had a
white count in the normal range around 7 and was also afebrile.
Surgery followed the patient during her stay in the hospital as
did Interventional Radiology. Bile was sent out for culture
which showed yeast as well as a gram stain which showed gram
positive cocci. The patient's antibiotics were switched to
Vancomycin , Levo and Flagyl. Initially the Vancomycin and Flagyl
were given IV and the Levo was given p.o. One day prior to
discharge , the patient's Flagyl was switched to p.o. and on the
day of discharge the Vancomycin was stopped after the patient had
received seven days of Vancomycin. The patient will be
discharged on Flagyl p.o. and Levo p.o. The patient was also
started no Fluconazole 100 to treat the yeast that was noted in
her bile cultures. The IR drain will need to be in the patient's
gallbladder for a minimum of six weeks or until the patient has
her elective cholecystectomy which will be scheduled at a later
date.
3. ID: The patient is colonized with MRSA and appropriate
precautions were taken and the patient was also noted to have an
infection in her gallbladder and was treated for it as such.
4. Pain: The patient was treated for abdominal pain during her
stay in the hospital with Demerol and also with Morphine.
5. Psychiatry: The patient was seen by Psychiatry on admission
to help manage her agitation and delirium. They did a
preliminary assessment of the patient. The patient did show
certain signs of agitation and multiple code grays had to be
called on the patient for difficult behavior , though the patient
was never in danger of truly hurting herself or others.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac chest pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis now resolved.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: ASA 325 , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 80
b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Levoxyl 175 , nadolol 80 , Lipitor
80 q.h.s. , Lantis 18 units , Diovan 80 , levofloxacin 500 every 24
hours to complete a 14 day course , Fluconazole 100 to complete a
14 day course , Flagyl 500 t.i.d. to complete a 14 day course ,
Plavix 75 , famotidine 20 b.i.d. , iron 325 q.day.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> is a 70-year-old woman with
a history of yellow nail syndrome ,
hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes ,
who has had multiple admissions since <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 2001. The first was
an admission to an outside hospital from <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/07/16</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/23/16.</PHI>
At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and was
diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial
effusion. She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drained
from her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. She
was discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heart
failure , secondary to cor pulmonale. The second admission was
from <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20/16</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/28/16</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vallejo , Voigt Mollie Izzo Woodrow</PHI> . At that time , she had
increased lower extremity edema. She was diuresed during that
admission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. An
echocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fraction
of 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-large
pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands.
A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a right
atrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of
38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressure
was 127/14. There was no constrictive pericardial disease or
restrictive cardiomyopathy. She also had no malignant cells in her
pleural effusion , which was exudated. ANCA , ANA , SPEP were
negative. She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass or
hydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.
The third admission was at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vallejo , Voigt Mollie Izzo Woodrow</PHI> from <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/08/16</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/16/16</PHI> , for
increasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity
edema. At that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient.
She had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudative
effusions. PFTs revealed a FEV1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an FVC of
1.26 , 43% of predicted , an FEV1/FVC ratio of 93% , a TLC of 2.07 ,
40% of predicted , and a DLCO of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. She
was ruled out for TB with serial ASBs during this admission.
She was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time ,
consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions ,
lymphedema and yellow fingernails. She was started on high dose
Vitamin E , and evaluated by CT surgery for a possible pleurodesis.
However , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose of
diuretics.
Since her discharge in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> , she has been aggressively diuresed ,
but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI>
2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and was
restarted on Lasix. Over the week prior to admission , she has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion. She has baseline shortness of
breath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. Her
weight at discharge in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> was 208 , and on admission she
currently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior to
admission. She denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough with
white sputum. She has had some substernal chest pain that is sharp
with dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation.
She also has increasing lower extremity edema. In the emergency
department , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 ,
respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2
liters. She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebs without
improvement and Lasix 160 mg IV with a 600 cc diuresis.

effusion is bigger than in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> 2001.
LENIS: Negative for evidence for deep venous thrombosis , but limited study.
SUMMARY: This is a 70-year-old woman with history of hypertension ,
diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , home 02
requirement and yellow nail syndrome. She was admitted with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain over
the past week prior to admission. She has most likely had a
failure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tapped
along with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome in
terms of recurrent pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary. We initially diuresed Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI>
with IV Lasix , along with Diuril. She had brisk
diuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. On
hospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and were
able to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. The fluid was
sent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as an
exudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. The cytology was
negative for any malignant cells. The pulmonary team was
consulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis to
prevent effusions from recurring. We consulted thoracic surgery ,
who requested a CT scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungs
for evidence of malignancy.
CT scan was done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/05/16</PHI> , but due to atelectasis and having to
do the study without IV contrast , there were areas in her right and
left lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have been
malignancies. CT surgery also requested cardiac clearance before
any definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset SVT. We obtained a
stress MIBI. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/10/16</PHI> , she was taken to the operating room for surgery
of the right chest. At that time , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Howell.</PHI> , the cardiothoracic
surgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedly
thickened and yellow. She also took a wedge biopsy of the right
lower lobe. Those biopsies have returned , and revealed mild
nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.
The diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoid
tissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. She had a chest tube placed
at the time of operation and tolerated that well. However , after that
procedure , she was deemed unstable by the PACU team and was
admitted to MICU overnight. She extubated without problems and
remained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygen
saturations in the 90%. She was readmitted to the medicine team
on the following day , <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/11/16.</PHI> Overall , she tolerated that
procedure well. Her chest tube that was placed on the right side
did not drain much fluid over the next few days. However , the
pleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we did
a thoracentesis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/11/16.</PHI> We removed 1 liter of turbid ,
yellowish brown fluid. The chemistries revealed a lymphocyte and
macrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at this
time. As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracic
surgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which has
shown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% of
the time. The pleurodesis was on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/13/16.</PHI> She tolerated this
procedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48
hours. The chest tube was pulled on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/15/16.</PHI>
Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> 's shortness of breath was much improved after the
initial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on her
home oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. The
plan is for her to see Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Howell.</PHI> in 2 weeks and also have a
follow-up chest x-ray. At that time , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Howell.</PHI> will determine if
there is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.
She can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initial
pleurodesis on the left.
2. Cardiovascular. Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> was tachycardic on admission , and
continued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. She was
initially diuresed with IV Lasix and Diuril , and was probably over
diuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.
On hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates in
the 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. She converted back to
normal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of IV calcium channel blockers and
a Diltiazem drip. She was then maintained on Diltiazem SR 60 mg PO
b.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinus
rhythm. However , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal HL
tachycardia during her MICU admission. At the time of admission ,
we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. She had a bedside
echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed a
trace pericardial effusion. She also had a dobutamine MIBI for
cardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. Her
heart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreased
from 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. The clinical response to
dobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response was
normal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. There
were no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or
rest images. However , only planer images could be obtained , due to
difficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. Her results
were determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of
hemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technically
limited.
In terms of her diuresis , Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> was kept on IV Lasix for only
the first few days of her admission , and then was switched to PO
diuretics. Initially at a dose of 200 mg PO b.i.d. , and then
decreased to 120 mg PO b.i.d. Her lower extremity edema decreased
significantly , along with her pleural effusions.
3. Renal. Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatinine
throughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. We caused a mild
contraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete her
electrolytes as needed. She will follow with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">NMDJC</PHI> for her
renal insufficiency as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine. Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> has type II diabetes and was on glyburide
5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. She continued that therapy as an
inpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during this
admission.
5. Rheumatology. Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> has a history of gout , and we were
concerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressive
diuresis. We continued her colchicine and decreased her
allopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. We also continued her Vitamin E
therapy for the yellow nail syndrome.
6. Hematology. She has chronic anemia , and we continued her iron
and Procrit treatment during the admission.
DISPOSITION: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VGTAD</PHI> will be discharged to home with VNA
services to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physical
therapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion in
her joints infected with gout. She has been instructed to make
follow-up appointments with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Howell.</PHI> in a few weeks , and to have
a chest x-ray on the day that she sees Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Howell.</PHI> She should also
follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">NMDJC</PHI> in the renal clinic.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/15/2917</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ORTHOSTATIC HYPERTENSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old woman
with end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis. She has history of hypertension treated with
Labetalol 400 mg PO t.i.d. and candesartan 32 mg PO q. day. She
came in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/07/17</PHI> with an episode of syncope while getting up
from the bathroom. There was no prodrome , no shortness of breath ,
no palpitations and no headache. She said they lasted for a few
seconds. She did not have any incontinence. No numbness , no
tingling , no dysarthria , no opposition , no motor events were
observed. She had a similar event in early <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> and one in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> ,
similar in nature following going to the bathroom and micturating.
She discontinued her own Labetalol for a week and was free of these
events during that time. However , restarted them. She did not
have any chest pain or shortness of breath. Of note , she has had
diabetes mellitus type II and has been poorly controlled. She is
on insulin for that.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for end stage renal disease ,
hypertension , obesity , diabetes mellitus
with peripheral neuropathy , as well as retinopathy and nephropathy ,
cellulitis in the past , anemia , history of uremic pericarditis and
nonerosive esophagitis and gastritis.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination was significant for
vital signs upon presentation , temperature
97.6 , blood pressure 148/88 , heart rate 78 , respirations were 20.
She was satting 99% on room air. In general , she was an obese
woman lying in comfortably in bed in no acute distress , appearing
slightly lethargic. ENT was unremarkable. Pharynx was benign.
Moist , mucous membranes , anicteric conjunctiva. Her heart was
regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2. She had 2/6 holosystolic ejection
murmur that was heard at the left sternal border. Her neck , she
had no carotid bruits , no jugular venous pressure. Pulses were
bilaterally symmetric in the carotid arteries. Her lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Extremities were warm and well
perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurologically , she was
intact. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact grossly. She was alert
and oriented x3. Gait was intact. Finger-to-nose intact.
Strength 5/5 bilaterally and symmetrically. Reflexes 2+
symmetrically. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender and there was
no hepatosplenomegaly.
LABORATORY VALUES: On admission , her sodium was 140 , potassium
4.3 , chloride 94 , bicarb 28 , BUN 52 , creatinine
2.9 , glucose 255 , CK initially was 449 , troponin .02 , calcium 9.8 ,
magnesium 1.9 , phosphorous 6.9. Her white blood cell count was
9.9 , hematocrit 34.4 , platelets 283. There was no left shift.
Her EKG showed a heart rate of 70 , normal sinus rhythm with Q-waves
in III and AVF. No new ST segment changes.
Head CT was negative in the emergency department as well. Chest
x-ray was unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a rule out for a myocardial
infarction and ruled out with enzymes and 0 EKGs
by hospital day #2. She underwent cardiac echocardiogram which was
negative. It showed only some LVH with mild aortic insufficiency
trace , and trace mitral insufficiency. She had cardiac ultrasounds
bilaterally , which were negative for any disease.
She demonstrated to be orthostatic with change in systolic blood
pressure of 40 mmHG from lying down to standing position multiple
times during this admission. This seemed to be exacerbated by
dialysis. In dialysis , her dry weight was increased and her blood
pressure medications were discontinued completely. She was seen by
cardiology as well. They recommended starting on DVAVP for most
likely an autonomic neuropathy causing orthostatic symptoms and
hypotension. There were no complications to her medical stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: She is being discharged on Tylenol 650 mg
PO q.4h. p.r.n. headache , calcium acetate
1334 mg PO t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg PO q. day , Insulin NPH 30 units S.C.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Resume all your normal home medications at the doses you were taking.
2. Your new medication is lasix , which helps remove excess fluid from the
body. Have your blood chemistries checked ( potassium , magnesium )
3. Make an appointment to see Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Navarro , Urbina Angelo</PHI> within one week.
4. Ask Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">ETNQ</PHI> to check your EKG on dofetilide to make sure that your
"QTc" ( heart function ) is not long due to metformin + dofetilide
5. Your sugars have been mildly elevated ( 190s ). Have your sugars
checked as meds adjusted as an outpt
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. follow up ECHO - Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Navarro , Urbina Angelo</PHI> will compare in-patient ECHO and priors
to determine interval change in valve function , ?when to undergo repair
vs. replacement
2. optimize medical regimen for management of mitral regurgitation ,
lasix + consider hydral + nitrates for afterload reduction ( pt was
told she had ?'lupus like' symptoms on lisinopril ). ACE-I would be
best if she can tolerate this

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/13/2912</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
had a two vessel coronary artery
bypass graft on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/30/12.</PHI> She was discharged to home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/7/12</PHI> to
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Yanira Innocent Garret Hinton.</PHI> where she developed
epigastric discomfort and recurrent atrial fibrillation and was
transferred back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> .
Her cardiac history dates back to <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1995 when she was
admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> for an asthma flare. At that
time she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were
negative. An exercise test at that time showed she was able to go
eight minutes on a Bruce protocol with 2 mm ST depressions in leads
2 , 3 , and F. A MIBI showed a small reversible defect inferiorly
and she was managed medically at that time.
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1996 she was again admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Venegas &Watson; Antione Clinic</PHI> with chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She was started on Prilosec for presumed
gastroesophageal reflux disease. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1996 an exercise
Thallium test showed she went eight minutes on a Bruce protocol
with a heart rate of 125 , blood pressure 170/80 , and no ECG
changes. She stopped secondary to chest pain.
From <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/2/12</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/6/12</PHI> she presented with chest pressure at
rest which radiated to her shoulders and jaw. On presentation she
was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. An ECG at that time
showed elevated T-waves in V1 and V2. She was treated with
Lopressor with slowing of the rate and relief of her chest pain.
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 473 with
an MB fraction of 32. Her Lopressor was changed to Verapamil
secondary to increased wheezing requiring nebulizers. The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed
an left anterior descending artery that had 70% proximal lesion
with collaterals , left circumflex artery with long 80 to 90%
stenosis , right coronary artery 30 to 40% stenosis , left ventricle
with ejection fraction of 58% , and apical akinesis. She
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. Following
catheterization the patient agreed to a coronary artery bypass
graft but the procedure was postponed until she received Epogen
therapy since she is a Jehovah's Witness. She was discharged in
sinus rhythm.
She returned on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/29/12</PHI> and underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times two which was complicated by a perioperative myocardial
infarction with inferior ST elevations and peak CK of 386 and MB
fraction of 8.1. Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with
Verapamil. The patient was loaded on Digoxin and had multiple
episodes of atrial fibrillation. She converted to normal sinus
rhythm and was discharged to rehabilitation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/7/12</PHI> in normal
sinus rhythm.
Her postoperative course was notable for gastrointestinal distress
with epigastric burning , reflux , nausea , vomiting , and
constipation. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/7/12</PHI> at rehabilitation the patient noted
worsening epigastric burning with a sour taste in her mouth. This
was relieved with Maalox. She was awakened from sleep with
epigastric burning radiating to the right back and palpitations.
ECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125 to 150 and
she was treated with Verapamil 2.5 mg IV times two and converted to
normal sinus rhythm. The patient was noted to have ST elevations
of 1 mm in 1 , 3 , and F and she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> for further evaluation. She had no complaint of shortness
of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , syncope , or
presyncope. At <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> she was noted to have
epigastric burning similar to a prior episode and was treated with
Maalox with relief.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was lying in bed in no apparent
distress. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx benign.
Neck: Supple. Full range of motion. No lymphadenopathy.
Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP 8 cm. Heart: No heave and no
thrill. Regular rate. S1 , split S2. 2/6 systolic murmur at apex.
Positive for frictional rub. Lungs clear to auscultation. No
wheeze or rhonchi. Chest had midline sternotomy without any
exudate or erythema. Sternum was stable. Back: No costovertebral
angle tenderness. Abdomen: Keloid in right upper quadrant. Soft ,
nontender , nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. Neurologic: Alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves II - XII intact. Intact sensation and
strength throughout. Reflexes symmetric and toes downgoing.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 129 , potassium 5.4 , creatinine 1.0 , BUN
20 , glucose 227. Digoxin level 2.6. Hematocrit
45.1 , WBC 9.2. Her triponin-1 level was 0.7. ECG at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> was in normal sinus rhythm. Normal left axis ,
normal intervals. 0.16 , 0.88 , 0.36. Rate of 85. Left atrial
enlargement. 1 mm ST depressions in 1 and 2 which is consistent
with Digoxin effect. 1 mm upsloping ST elevations in 2 , 3 , and F
unchanged from prior ECG on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/6/12.</PHI> Chest x-ray showed mediastinal
shadow. Stable with question of atelectasis at left base.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and her chest burning was primarily due to
gastrointestinal reflux which was relieved with Maalox , as well as
chest discomfort in her left shoulder which was due to
musculoskeletal pain and was relieved with Tylenol and Percocet or
Darvocet. On monitor she showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation
although she did have supraventricular tachycardia and one incident
of a ten-beat run. In light of the fact that the patient is a
Jehovah's Witness and is not a candidate for being Coumadinized for
episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation , it was felt that we would
use the anti-arrhythmic agent , Propafenone , to prevent episodes in
the perioperative period of atrial fibrillation. Her Digoxin was
discontinued and she tolerated Propafenone load of 150 mg t.i.d.
well along with her Verapamil dose.
Other issues during this admission were that her blood sugar was
high requiring sliding scale of insulin. Also the patient had
hyponatremia with sodium in the high 120s and low 130s throughout
her stay , as well as a potassium which was mildly elevated , ranging
from 5.0 to 5.8. Cortisol levels were drawn and results are
pending for possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The question of
a renal tubular acidosis type IV was raised.
Throughout the admission her chest burning was well controlled with
Maalox. Her Pepcid dose was increased to 20 mg b.i.d.
Helicobacter pylori and IgG antibodies were sent and results are
pending. Her musculoskeletal pain which is primarily in her left
shoulder radiating to her arm has been well controlled with
Tylenol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary history as above ,
asthma which has required hospitalization in
the past but no intubations , adult-onset diabetes mellitus for
which she takes Micronase , hypertension , gastroesophageal reflux
disease , hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy , left
lower lobe granuloma followed by chest CT scan , and cataracts.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4h , Albuterol inhaler
2 puffs q.i.d. , Ecasa 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Beclovent 2 sprays t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Epogen 10 , 000
units subcu three times a week , Gliburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Mevacor

p.o. t.i.d. , Verapamil SR 120 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: Beta blockers and Lisinopril. It is questionable
whether she has allergy to Naprosyn as well.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives at home with her daughter. No alcohol.
No tobacco.
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Yanira Innocent Garret Hinton.</PHI> She will likely require a
short course of physical therapy and rehabilitation and will be
returning to home following her course of rehabilitation.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow-up in the future with her primary care
physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hobbs G. Parthenia</PHI> , as well as with her cardiologist , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Elmo.</PHI> CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is stable on the day
of discharge.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease status post
inferior myocardial infarction.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Inferior myocardial infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Rheumatoid arthritis , myocardial infarction ,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease
status post carotid endarterectomy , status post cerebrovascular
accident , gastroesophageal reflux disease , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral artery aneurysm , and depression.
The patient is a 77-year-old female with coronary artery disease
who presented to an outside hospital with chest pain that she
thought was GERD but became concerned when it started radiating
down her left arm. At the outside hospital , she was noted to be
febrile with temperature 39.8 and noted on EKG to have ST
elevations in the inferior leads. The patient was med-flighted
to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for an emergent cath. The patient had 70%
LAD lesion , 50% proximal RCA , and 90% mid RCA lesion that was
stented to 0% , and a 60% PDA lesion , and LVEDP of 33 on initial
cath. Started on Integrilin post cath and transferred to CCU.
The patient did well in the CCU and was transferred out on the
next day. Previous to admission , the patient resided in a
assisted living facility and was fairly active but has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion , decreasing exercise tolerance
over the past six months.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature was 98.8 , heart
rate was in the 70s , BP was 120s/60s , respirations was 22 ,
saturation was 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Generally , she is
an obese female in mild distress. Some cough. Her HEENT exam
showed a clear oropharynx. No erythema or injection. Skin had
no rashes or other lesions. Neck was supple with full range of
motion. JVP was approximately 2 with 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. No thyromegaly or nodules. Chest was noted to have
diffuse wheezing with bilateral bibasilar crackles. Questionable
right-sided consolidation , PMI nondisplaced with a regular rate
and rhythm with S4 , S1 with physiologically split S2. No
significant murmurs or rubs. Abdomen was nondistended and
nontender. Positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Her
extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 2+ femoral ,
DP , and PT pulses. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented
with normal mental status and nonfocal exam. Her chest x-ray
showed evidence of pulmonary edema with focal consolidation of
right upper lobe with chest consistent with pneumonia. Her EKG
on admission , was normal sinus rhythm in the 60s with normal axis
and inferior Q waves with T-wave inversions inferiorly and
laterally.
IMPRESSION: This is a 77-year-old female status post IMI with
concurrent COPD exacerbation secondary to probable right upper
lobe pneumonia.
HOSPIATL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient did very well status post
revascularization. She did have some persistent pain while in
the intensive care unit and this went away on transfer to the
floor. She was medically optimized and continued on aspirin and
Plavix , added a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor to the patient's
1B pump. The patient had compensated heart function on
discharge , euvolemic , but she did require intermittent Lasix.
She was discharged on Lasix to treat heart failure. Rhythm-wise ,
the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the course
of hospitalization.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
with a rapid prednisone taper , and her home nebulizers , and a
10-day course of levofloxacin. Incidentally , the patient also
admitted to having a TB exposure. We placed a TB and that was
nonreactive and had induced sputums that were negative x 3.
3. Renal: The patient had well preserved renal function
normalized at discharge.
4. FEN: The patient was tolerating oral diet well and was
indicated on her instructions that she should have low-calorie ,
low-fat , low-cholesterol diet particularly given her diabetes and
she should watch her sugar and was maintained on her own.
5. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of depression and
noted to be depressed throughout the course of hospitalization
with some suicidal ideations toward the end of her
hospitalization. For that reason , we requested that psychiatry
come and evaluate her. They did so deeming her safe to return to
her facility and adjusting her antidepressants. The patient was
discharged in stable condition.
Procedures included percutaneous coronary intervention with
stenting to her right coronary artery x 2. Please see full
report for details.
Her discharge medications include aspirin 325 mg , atenolol 25 mg
p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Atrovent inhaler two to four puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. , lisinopril 2.5
mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. insomnia or
anxiety , prednisone she was completing a taper with 40 mg x 2
days , 20 mg x 2 days , 10 mg x 2 days , and then off , trazodone 50
mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. sleep , Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Flovent 110

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCT.
CONTRIBUTING DIAGNOSIS: HYPERTENSION , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ,
DIABETES , SCHIZOPHRENIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old black
female with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease , SVT and schizophrenia
presented with 45 minutes of substernal burning , shortness of
breath and diaphoresis. The patient has a long history of chest
pain which began in 1988 with her first rule out for MI. She has
had extensive cardiac workup including a recent ETT MIBI during
which she went 5 minutes 40 seconds with a maximum heart rate of
71 , blood pressure of 138/68 with no ST segment changes and no
evidence for ischemia. MIBI images: anteroapical defect on stress
images with reperfusion at rest consistent with ischemia. These
studies were done in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1992. The patient was thought to have
rate related ischemia which is induced by SVTs or other
precipitants that increase her heart rate. The patient has had no
substernal chest pressures since <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1992. She experiences no
chest discomfort on exertion. She has had a good rate control on
Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient presented in the Emergency
Room today complaining of epigastric burning in her chest 1 time a
week which awakened her from sleep at night. It is usually relieved
by Mylanta. On the day of admission , however , the patient
experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest burning without
radiation while lying in bed. She had eaten 1 hour before going to
bed. The pain was accompanied by palpitations , shortness of breath
and diaphoresis. She denied nausea and vomiting. It was not
relieved by Mylanta. The patient received a sublingual
nitroglycerin in the ambulance resulting in relief. The patient's
cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes , history of
tobacco use and hypercholesterolemia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As
above: Adult onset diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a left great
toe ingrown toe nail , diverticulosis , history of frequent nose
bleed , multiple right pinna ear infection , schizophrenia , history
of colonic polyps with guaiac positive stools in 1987 and a barium
enema the same year demonstrating colonic diverticula , degenerative
joint disease of the knees. MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission:
Verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d , Naprosyn 375mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. ,
fluphenazine 35cc IM q 2 weeks , Ibuprofen 400mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Nitropatch , Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 45 units
q.a.m. , Pepcid 20mg b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 1 tablet p.o. q
d , Librium 10mg p.o. b.i.d. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known
drug allergies. Family history includes a brother who died at 60 of
an MI , a sister who died at 71 of an MI. Social History: The
patient is a widow with 4 children , lives with grandson , a retired
factory seamstress who stopped smoking 25 years ago. She had smoked
a 1/2 pack a day for 5 years and has no history of ethanol usage.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant black female in no
apparent distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
pulse of 100 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations at 16. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Oropharynx was clear.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. Heart: Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with distant heart sounds and normal S1 , S2. Abdomen:
Abdomen was with normal bowel sounds , was soft , obese and
non-tender with a hyperpigmented patch centrally. EXTREMITIES:
Extremities are without edema or joint effusions. The left great
toe had hypertrophic toe nails , tender to palpation with an ingrown
toenail. Rectal was with guaiac positive stool. NEURO: Neuro exam
was grossly non-focal. Skin had no new rashes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admission data included a sodium of 144 ,
a potassium of 4 , chloride of 107 , bicarb
of 27 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.1 , glucose of 155. CK was 430
with an MB fraction of 1.5 and as an aside , the patient is known to
have chronically elevated CKs. White count was 8.7 , hematocrit of
36 with an MCV of 90 and 93 , 000 platelets. PT 13 , PTT 30. LFTs
were within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at
95 beats per minute with intervals of .18 , .81 , .35 and axis of 21
with Q waves in V1 , V2 , T wave flattening in V2. Chest x-ray was
without infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course by system: The patient was ruled
out for MI , had CKs of 430 with an MB fraction of
1.544 with an MB fraction of 1.9 and 404 with an MB fraction of .8.
There were no further EKG changes. The patient had no chest pain
while in the hospital. The patient's Lopressor was increased to
75mg q.i.d. while in house and the patient also underwent a
diagnostic cardiac catheterization with the following results: An
LAD without critical stenosis , an OMB1 with a 90% proximal stenosis
and OMB2 with diffuse disease and serial lesions , an RCA with a
proximal 90% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis , and normal
ventricular function. The patient was offered PTCA of her critical
lesions and the patient declined. As the patient had not been
compliant with her medical regimen , it was felt that we would send
her out on her increased dosage of Lopressor and monitor her level
of chest discomfort and perhaps re-offer her PTCA at a later date.
The patient's toe was evaluated by podiatry who felt that she had ,
in fact , an ingrown toenail which was treated via avulsion of the
margin of the nail and a 4 day course of Cephradine 500mg p.o.
q.i.d. The patient had all Ansaid held secondary to her guaiac
positive stool and her hematocrit monitored and it suggested that
the patient have a GI workup as an outpatient. The patient had
anemia which was thought secondary to chronic GI bleed. Iron
studies performed while in house detected an iron level of 31 ,
total iron binding capacity of 246 , a B12 of 904 , folate of 10.4 ,
and a ferritin of 235; all not consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia which was
thought perhaps secondary to Pepcid or Ansaid. These medications
were held while she was in house and her platelet level remained
approximately 100 and was so upon discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient continued her normal medical regimen for
schizophrenia and was discharged in stable condition
on the following medicines: MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin
325mg a day , Librium 10mg b.i.d. , NPH insulin 42 units sub q
q.a.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. t.i.d. , verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d ,
Prolixin Decanoate 12.5mg IM q o weekly and nitroglycerin 1/150 1
tablet sublingual q 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n. chest pain. The patient
will have home health aid and VNA services to ensure more
compliance with medication regimen and diet , also to check finger
stick glucose every day , blood pressure every week and to
administer her Prolixin every week. The patient is recommended to
be on a 800 ADA diet and will have follow-up with Dr.
in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> Clinic.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/27/2912</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">TNSGPS</PHI> is a 69 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1996. She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , which
showed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80%
left circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronary
artery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion.
She was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with an
ejection fraction of 52%. The patient expressed her desire to be
managed conservatively , and was medically managed for the following
year. She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to discharge
and one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minutes
with less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. The
patient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m.
on the morning of admission when she woke from sleep with
substernal chest pain. She took sublingual nitroglycerin with
relief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred with
nausea. The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin with
resolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. She presented to the emergency
department free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showed
changes consistent with anterior ischemia. The patient was
admitted with unstable angina for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. ,
sublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril
5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygen
saturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula. There was no
evidence of jugular venous distention , carotids 2+ bilaterally , no
bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and an S4 was
present. Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender and nondistended with
normal bowel sounds present. Extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission the patient's initial CK was 111.
Her second CK was 452 , with an MB fraction of
45.1 , third CK was 550 with an MB fraction of 47.9 , and a fourth CK
of 439 with MB fraction of 33.5 , fifth CK of 261 , with MB fraction
of 14.9 , and a sixth CK of 156. SMA seven was normal.
Troponin I was 0.0 on admission. White blood count of 11 ,
hematocrit 39.7. Chest x-ray was unremarkable for any infiltrate
or any congestive heart failure evidence. Electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75 , axis 0 , 2 to 3 ST segment
elevation in V1 through V3 , 1 mm elevation in V4 , less than 1 mm ST
segment depressions in 1 , AVL , and V5 , V6. These changes were new
compared to a previous electrocardiogram from <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1996.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to CCU , at which time
she was pain free and her electrocardiogram
abnormalities had resolved. Her heart rate and blood pressure were
controlled with intravenous medications and she was managed
medically until hospital day three when she was taken of the
cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac catheterization
revealed a 90% plus left anterior descending artery lesion distal
to D1 with evidence of thrombus , 60% proximal left circumflex
lesion with diffuse disease in the OM1 , a 40% right coronary artery
lesion , left ventriculogram revealed anterior lateral apical and
septal HK and AK. The patient returned to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory the following day for PTCA and stenting
of her left anterior descending artery lesion followed by ReoPro
infusion. From the time of her admission to the Cardiac Care Unit
throughout her hospital stay the patient did not have recurrence of
her chest pain. Cardiac enzymes returned to baseline.
Electrocardiogram revealed ST segments also returned to baseline.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Ticlid 250
mg p.o. b.i.d. for 11 days , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enalapril
20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is instructed to resume a low fat , low
cholesterol diet. Activity as tolerated.

SERVICE: General Medical Service , <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</PHI>
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS.
IDENTIFICATION: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iverson</PHI> is a 69 year old gentleman with a
history of adult onset diabetes mellitus ,
peripheral vascular disease , chronic hemorrhagic cystitis who is
currently transfusion dependent , who was admitted with congestive
heart failure and elevated CK , MB in the setting of profound anemia
and presents for a blood transfusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a long , complex
urologic history which includes
prostate cancer which was treated with radiation approximately
twenty years ago. More recently , superficial bladder cancer which
was treated with partial resection. He developed hematuria
approximately <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> 1995. A workup revealed hemorrhagic cystitis
which was felt to be secondary to prior radiation treatments. He
has required approximately 1 unit of red cells per week for the
past three months to keep up with ongoing urologic blood loss.
The patient has no known cardiac history. His risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension , tobacco use , and male sex. No history of
hypercholesterolemia or family history. He describes 4-5 episodes
of chest tightness occurring over the past five years , the last
episode occurring approximately three months ago. He does note
progressive pedal edema over the past six weeks and over the past
two to three days has had increasing fatigue and dyspnea on
exertion. On the day prior to admission , routine VNA blood draw
revealed a hematocrit of 17. His primary care physician was
notified and the patient was instructed to report to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> on the day of admission for transfusion. Repeat
hematocrit on the day of admission was 18. He received two units
of packed red cells and chemotherapy infusion and shortly after
transfusion developed shortness of breath without chest pain.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. His
initial CK was 770 with 70 MB fraction. The patient was
transferred to the Emergency Room for further evaluation where he
was treated with topical Nitro paste , 40 mg of IV Lasix , resulting
in 1500 cc of urine output. Aspirin and heparin were held
secondary to hemorrhagic cystitis. Beta blocker was also held
secondary to question of bronchospasm.
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
further treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. AODM. 2. Peripheral vascular disease.
3. Neuropathy. 4. Prostate cancer. 5.
Bladder cancer in 1995 and 1990. 6. Status post appendectomy. 7.
History of TIAs three to four years ago. Workup revealed 50%
bilateral carotid stenosis. 8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes edema. Steroids cause cytosis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cardizem CD
180 mg p.o. q.day , folate 1 mg p.o. q.day ,
iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of leukemia. Father had a CVA and
kidney problems. No known coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Two pack per day smoking , 1-2 drinks per day. The
patient is a retired teacher at a <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Rhode Island</PHI> He currently lives alone and is single.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant older gentleman in no
apparent distress. Temperature 98.6 , blood
pressure 110/62 , heart rate 98. Oxygen saturation of 97% on 2
liters. HEENT: Examination is benign , no JVD , JVP was at 7 cm ,
neck was supple. CHEST: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIAC: 2+
carotids , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Two frontal scars , liver was palpable 2 cm
below the right costal margin. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended , normal bowel sounds , no masses. BACK: No CVA or
spinal tenderness. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ left greater than right pedal edema. Superficial
ulcers on bilateral soles. NEURO: Alert and oriented times three.
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 132 , potassium 4.7 , chloride
96 , bicarb 25 , BUN 7 , creatinine
0.9 , glucose 186 , CK of 776 , MB 70.5. LFTs were within normal
limits. Hematocrit was 28.3 , white count 10.4 , platelet count 283 ,
PT 13.5 , PTT 26.2 , normal differential.
Urinalysis grossly bloody , 10-20 white cells.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with small bilateral
effusions , right greater than left , plus Kerley B-lines.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 90 , intervals 212/72/368 , and axis 7
degrees. No ischemic changes.
ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: This is a 69 year old gentleman with multiple
cardiac risk factors , chronic anemia secondary
to severe hemorrhagic cystitis , no transfusion dependent , who was
admitted with congestive heart failure after blood transfusion and
positive CK , MB. No definitive EKG changes and no clear history of
angina but recent history of increased pedal edema. The patient
likely had recent myocardial infarction and congestive heart
failure in the setting of transfusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit
for further care. As mentioned above , heparin
and aspirin were held secondary to the risk of worsening
hemorrhagic cystitis. The patient received further blood
transfusions to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30. He remained
in the Cardiac Care Unit overnight. Serial CKs revealed an A set
of 776 ( MB 70.5 ) , B set 747 ( MB 54.7 ) , C set 564 ( MB 33.2 ). CTNI
was 25.1. EKG's were without evolution. The patient was therefore
ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram
was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/9/11</PHI> which showed normal LV function , mild LVH ,
no regional wall motion abnormalities but of a somewhat suboptimal
quality. The patient received a total of four units of red blood
cells with a subsequent rise in hematocrit from 17 to 30.1 by the
first hospital day and received initially 40 mg of IV Lasix in the
Emergency Room , followed by two doses of 20 mg with excellent urine
output.
The patient was transferred from the CCU to General Medical
Service , <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</PHI> on his second hospital day , <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/9/11.</PHI> His post MI
course was uncomplicated , notable only for two runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight on the first
hospital day. The patient had no recurrent angina and no recurrent
evidence of congestive heart failure.
He underwent a routine post MI submax ETT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/12/11.</PHI> The patient
went 4 minutes and 4 seconds with a peak work load of 31 , peak
heart rate of 80 , and peak blood pressure of 160/80. He stopped
secondary to fatigue. He occasional PVC's but no chest pain and no
ST changes. The test was thought to show no evidence of ischemia
but had a low work load. It was thought appropriate to discharge
the patient to home for further medical management and further
urologic workup as an outpatient. The most important medical
intervention would be to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 with
vigilant monitoring. During this admission , the patient received a
total of six units of packed red cells. and had a hematocrit of
30.9 on discharge.
From a urologic standpoint , the patient was followed by Urology
during his hospitalization , who felt that his condition was
secondary to radiation cystitis. Given that he was now having
hematuria to the extent of requiring frequent transfusions , surgery
i.e. a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely be
necessary in the near future. He will continue to follow-up with
Urology as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , folic
acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Glyburide 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n. chest pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition and will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nedra Urenda</PHI> and also with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ignacio Ian Oreilly Xiaqun</PHI> as well as Urology.

Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">EWJWD</PHI> is a 43-year-old man with morbid obesity , type II
diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , chronic renal
insufficiency , and severe peripheral arterial disease status post
femoral popliteal bypass in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> which was complicated by repeated
return of cellulitis x 2 who was admitted with cellulitis and
volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient has had two wound complications after his femoral
popliteal bypass requiring two separate incisions and drainages
including courses of intravenous nafcillin x 4 weeks and with
vancomycin x 4 weeks. He had been seen by Vascular Surgery five
days prior to admission and had been started on dicloxacillin for
a third episode of cellulitis. He had also presented with fluid
overload and spironolactone was added to his diuretic regimen.
His primary care provider saw him the day prior to admission , and
the patient reported a recent fall and the primary care physician
recommended admission to the hospital. The patient does report
some fever and shaking chills and decreased appetite. Also ,
reported weakness in bilateral lower extremities and right foot
pain. He has chronic loss of sensation in both feet.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Morbid obesity , type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline creatinine of 2-2.5 , dyslipidemia , hypertension ,
coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , anemia ,
history of deep vein thrombosis , obstructive sleep apnea , anger
disorder , peptic ulcer disease , and tinea pedis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol 100 mg q.d. , spironolactone , torsemide 160 mg b.i.d. ,
Hyzaar 50/12.5 q. day , lisinopril 60 mg q. day , Neurontin 1200 mg
t.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m. , Coumadin 8 mg ,
aspirin , Humalog sliding scale , Percocet , Pletal 100 mg b.i.d. ,
Procrit , Zantac , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and NPH 80 q.a.m. and
q.p.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On physical exam , the patient was afebrile and had a temperature
of 99 , a heart rate of 70 , blood pressure 200/79 possibly taken
with an undersized cuff , 18 and 99% on room air. He is obese and
comfortable man in bed and in no acute distress. His JVP could
not be assessed from the size of his neck. Heart sounds were
distant. Chest was clear. His abdomen is obese with bowel
sounds , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: Notable for 3+
edema , and including 1+ extending to the groin. His pulses were
Dopplerable bilaterally with a triphasic wave on the right and
biphasic on the left. The medial aspect of his right leg had a
surgical scar. A healed annular burn wound in the medial knee
and an area of erythema along the scar with warmth , moderate
tenderness , no fluctuance and minimal induration , no discharge.
The diameter of his right leg was greater than his left. His
right heel had an intact ??blough?? and his left heel had a dry
pressure sore. His right big toe was tender to palpation.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Labs were notable for a creatinine of 3.4 and an INR of 7.1. His
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 75.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
Problem #1. Infectious Disease: The patient was started on
vancomycin IV on admission for his right medial thigh cellulitis
at the site of the femoropopliteal bypass with rapid
defervescence and improvement. No drainage , no fluctuance.
Additional antibiotic coverage was added specifically of
fluoroquinolone for anti-psuedomonal coverage for his diabetic
foot ulcers. The right heel also looked increasingly purulent
during his hospitalization and bilateral foot plain films were
done. These were negative for osteomyelitis but showed a metal
sliver in the right foot and an acute fracture of the first
metatarsal. Surgical debridement was done in the operating room
with drainage of pus , but the metal showed could not be located
even with fluoroscopy. The patient will complete a 14-day course
of levofloxacin and clindamycin for these foot ulcers , and will
be discharged home with visiting nursing care for b.i.d.
wet-to-dry dressing changes. He will follow up with <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Scott Hendricks James</PHI> , M.D. in one to two weeks.
Problem #2. Renal: The patient was volume overloaded on
admission. His torsemide was changed to IV and metolazone was
added and was given 30 minutes prior to his first torsemide dose
of the day. A diuresis of 1.5-2 liters a day was achieved with
this regimen with the exception of a 4 liter diuresis overnight
on the first day of admission. His electrolytes were replaced as
needed. I have expected his creatinine increase to 4.5 by
discharge. He will need close renal follow ups as he may be
approaching need for dialysis. The Renal Service followed him
during this hospitalization and at their recommendation ,
spironolactone will be discontinued upon discharge since his
diuresis will be slowed.
Problem #3. Vascular: Diuresis was essential for resolution of
his cellulitis. Pletal was continued and because of his severe
peripheral arterial disease , he will require excellent wound care
to optimize healing.
Problem #4. Heme: Initially , his Coumadin was held for a
supratherapeutic INR. This was restarted when his INR was 2.2
and he his now in the therapeutic range and will need to be
followed.
Problem #5. Cardiovascular: He was hypertensive on arrival
which was treated with Hydralazine initially and transitioned to
his p.o. home medicines. Even with a large cuff , his blood
pressure continued to run high in the 150s-180s. On hospital day
#9 , Hydralazine p.o. was added with good effect which lowered his
systolic blood pressure to the range of the 120s-130s. Goal is
below 130/80.
Problem #6. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with NPH and
Humalog. The Diabetes Service saw the patient and at their
recommendation NPH doses were increased , and he is now on 90
units in the morning and 85 units at night. The goal for this
patient is below 150 particularly given the need for wound
healing.
Problem #7: GI: The patient was seen by Nutrition and will be
evaluated as an outpatient by Bariatric Surgery pending next
week. This is of utmost importance for this patient with
life-threatening morbid obesity who already has severe
complications of obesity-related conditions. The patient has
obesity , hyperventilation syndrome.
Problem #8. Pulmonary: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea.
A CPAP machine was brought to the patient bedside , but the
patient was unable to tolerate the nose mask. He will use his
own device when he returns home.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
He will go home with visiting nurse care and will need to see his
nephrologist , vascular surgeons , primary care provider , and
Bariatric Surgery following discharge.

90 BPM.
Respiratory: Saturating well on 2 liters of oxygen delivered by
nasal cannula so was moderate chest tube output.
Diet: Advanced as tolerated.
Renal: Postop increase in creatinine requiring dopamine ,
creatinine now down to 1.5. P.o. Lasix started.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with aspirin.
ID: Antibiotics are off. Afebrile.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her two grandchildren and
her daughter. She does not use tobacco and does
not drink alcohol. She is originally from <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</PHI> where the rest
of her family currently lives. She left there several months ago.
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient was a pleasant woman lying comfortably
in bed in no apparent distress. Her temperature was 98.4 , pulse
106 , blood pressure 150/70 , respiratory rate 20 , saturation 95% on
room air. HEENT: Surgical right pupil , anicteric sclera , no nasal
discharge , moist oropharynx. Neck: Supple. No jugular venous
distention and no lymphadenopathy , full range of motion. Lungs:
Diffusely rigorous , no crackles or wheezes bilaterally.

no murmurs. Abdomen: Normal active bowel sounds. Soft ,
non-tender , non-distended and no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities:
No edema. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurological:
Mild decreased sensation left side of face , otherwise cranial
nerves III-XII are grossly intact. Reflexes in upper extremities
were 1 plus , no reflexes elicited in lower extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.3 , hematocrit 43 ,
platelet count 312. BUN 20 , creatinine 1.4 ,
glucose 377 , LDH 220. Sputum revealed 4+ polys , 4+ epithelial
cells , gram negative and gram positive cocci. Chest x-ray revealed
no evidence of congestive heart failure and no infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 69 year-old woman with a history of
congestive heart failure and hypertension who
presented with a productive cough which was worsening over the past
3-4 days and fever to 101 with chills and shakes and increasing
shortness of breath. She was afebrile however at the time of
admission. Her exam was remarkable for diffuse rhonchi and
moderate jugular venous distention. She had a white blood cell
count of 9.3 with 54% polys and 9.6 % eosinophils. Blood glucose
of 377 and a chest x-ray without evidence of congestive heart
failure or infiltrate. She was treated in the emergency room with
Albuterol nebulizer and plans were to discharge her to home ,
however , her saturations dropped to 89% on room air with exercise
in the emergency room and was admitted for further observation.
She was started on intravenous Cefuroxime , and initially improved
with decrease in cough and shortness of breath however , the patient
continued to desat with exercise. A repeat chest x-ray was
performed which showed no change when compared to the admission
film. Her sputum culture grew out Pen-sensitive E-coli and she was
continued on her intravenous and then PO antibiotics. She
continued to desat with exercise , however , and her cough persisted
although she remained afebrile with a slightly elevated white count
and moderate peripheral eosinophilia. Her chest exam remained
rancorous and the reason for this remained unclear. Given the
finding of E-coli in the sputum sample , in addition to the elevated
eosinophilia and lack of finding on chest x-ray despite significant
findings on chest exam , the possibility of a worm or parasitic
disease was raised. The patient is from <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</PHI> but had not been
there in 8 years. She did have a history of diarrhea for several
weeks a few months prior to this admission. Stool specimen was
sent but was rejected by the laboratory and the patient was unable
to produce another stool specimen before discharge. The patient
was discharged to home with Albuterol inhaler and instructions to
follow up with her primary physician. In addition , plans were made
for her to have PFTs done as an outpatient and plan for chest CT if
her symptoms continued without other etiology being discovered.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po
q day. 2 ) Cefuroxime 500 mg PO b.i.d.
3 ) Premarin 0.625 mg PO q day. 4 ) Lasix 40 mg PO q day. 5 )
Tofranil 75 mg PO q HS. 6 ) Zestril 20 mg PO b.i.d. 7 ) Verapamil
SR 120 mg PO b.i.d. 8 ) Insulin 70/30 28 units q a.m. and 5 units
q p.m. subcue. 9 ) Potassium slow release 10 mEq PO q day. 10 )
Albuterol inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d.
DISPOSITION: At the time of discharge the patient's saturation was
92 to 93% on room air and dropping slightly to 90 to
91% with exercise , however she was tolerating this well and was
getting relief from her Albuterol inhaler. She was to finish a
full ten day course of antibiotics for presumed bronchitis and to
follow up with her primary physician in clinic for further
evaluation including PFTs and possible chest CT if symptoms did not
abate.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/08/2906</PHI>
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
STATUS POST MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 45 year old
gentleman with a history of a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-06.</PHI> He was also recently
involved in a motor vehicle accident , and has had left pressure
since the accident. His cardiac history began in <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-06</PHI> , when he
suffered a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. A cardiac
catheterization at that time revealed a 90% proximal left anterior
descending lesion with anterolateral akinesis , which was treated
with angioplasty. He had a limited stress test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-29-06</PHI> , which
was limited by symptoms of chest pressure. The electrocardiogram
and thallium done at that time were both unrevealing. The patient
was involved in a motor vehicle accident in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> , and then again
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , 1991. He suffered multiple contusions , but no fractures.
Subsequent to the accidents , however , he described having left
flank and left side pain , which was exacerbated by movement and was
associated with the development of his left substernal chest
pressure. Nitroglycerin did seem to provide him some relief. The
patient was seen recently at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nicole Yeater Clinic</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</PHI> for chest
discomfort , and electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes did not show
any evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient has continued
to complain of chest discomfort over the past month , but all
electrocardiograms have been negative. An exercise tolerance test
was performed at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nicole Yeater Clinic</PHI> , which was positive for
chest discomfort and for ST depressions in the inferolateral leads.
Thallium examination was not performed because of infiltration of
the intravenous access. He was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nicole Yeater Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-4-06</PHI> , for further work-up and possible cardiac
catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a well
nourished , well appearing young black male.
His blood pressure was 130/80 , pulse 55 , respiratory rate 12. Lungs
were clear. Cardiac examination revealed S1 , S2 , with an S4
present , the jugular venous pressure was 5. The patient had 2+
carotid upstrokes without bruits. The abdomen was soft , good bowel
sounds , with left-sided tenderness and left flank tenderness to
palpation. Extremities showed no edema and good distal pulses.
Neurologic examination showed cranial nerves intact , motor
examination showed some decreased power on the left , but this was
thought secondary to pain. Sensory examination was normal , and his
plantar reflexes were downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , potassium was 4.6 ,
creatinine 1.3 , ALT 155 , AST 80 , LDH 228 ,
creatinine kinase 79 , cholesterol 212 , triglyceride 316 , white
blood count 6.1 , hematocrit 39 , prothrombin time 13.5 , partial
thromboplastin time 89.4. Admission chest x-ray showed no
abnormalities. Admission electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 56 beats per minute with some inverted T-waves in leads
II , III , F , and V2 through V4. The inverted T-wave in lead II
appeared to be new from a transfer electrocardiogram.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-4-06</PHI> , and was seen
by the Dental Service for his atypical pain
radiating to the neck. His cardiac risk factors included a
positive family history and a smoking history of less than 1 pack
per day. He had no history of diabetes or previous hypertension.
The patient continued to have chest pain , which responded only to
morphine. He underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-5-06</PHI> , which
revealed a right dominant circulation , kinking of the proximal left
anterior descending artery with a 70% stenosis. The patient
tolerated the cardiac catheterization well without hematoma or
bruit in the right groin. The patient continued to have episodes
of chest pain with 5/10 left-sided sternal chest pain without clear
electrocardiogram changes from the admission electrocardiogram. He
underwent an exercise tolerance test which showed he had 4/10 chest
pain prior to beginning the exercise tolerance test , but then got
worsening chest pain during the test after 8 minutes and 15
seconds , peak heart rate 160 , blood pressure 166/40. He did
develop 1 millimeter of downsloping ST depressions in the lateral
leads , and a pseudonormalization of the T-waves. The results were
discussed with the patient and the options were discussed , that is
medical management versus a repeat angioplasty or possible surgery.
The patient preferred medical management and wanted to be at home
to see if increased medical management would stabilize his chest
pain. The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-8-06.</PHI>
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. He was to have
close FOLLOW-UP and management of his cardiac disease
with the Cardiology Group. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included
Motrin 600 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , diltiazem 90
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , Lopressor 50 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , Pepcid 20
milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as
needed for pain , and Halcion 0.25 milligrams by mouth at hour of
sleep. The patient had a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Carmella</PHI> in
<PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Carlsbad, Nevada</PHI>

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Clotted AV fistula , atrial fibrillation ,
and change in mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iluminada Wiggins</PHI> is a 61-year-old female
with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post
cardiac transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary
artery disease , rejection x2 , post transplant MVR and TVR , also
with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension and a subacute change in her mental status over the
last few months that presented with a clot in her right upper
extremity AV fistula. Her last hemodialysis session was two days
prior to admission , and she is usually dialyzed on Mondays ,
Wednesdays and Fridays. Interventional radiology did not perform
a thrombectomy of the right upper extremity fistula clot , as the
patient's systolic blood pressures were in the 90s , and they were
concerned about the patient's change in mental status as she
would need conscious sedation for the procedure. She was also
noted upon admission to have an EKG that displayed an atrial
tachyarrhythmia with 2:1 block that was presumed to be atrial
flutter. Her heart rate was noted to be in the 110s to 120s , and
the rest of her vital signs were stable. The patient denied any
chest pain , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or
palpitations. It should be noted however that the patient was
not entirely conversant. After speaking with the patient's son ,
more information was obtained about this patient's subacute
change in her mental status. The patient was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>
of 2004 for a fall and femur fracture. During that admission ,
the son stated that the patient had an acute change in her mental
status such that she did not know who she was or where she was.
She was not answering questions appropriately. This was
persistent during that hospital stay and was of unclear etiology.
Prior to that admission , the patient is at baseline oriented to
person , place and time , and she is also very conversant. The son
does admit that the patient occasionally becomes confused about
the day of the week. Upon discharge from that admission , the
patient was sent to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanhorn Harper Gabriela.</PHI> for rehabilitation. The
son says that over the last few months , she has become slightly
better but definitely not at her baseline. He states that she is
often disoriented to person and place , although she does answer
some questions appropriately. The day prior to her admission ,
the patient's other son visit with her at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanhorn Harper Gabriela.</PHI> and
did not notice any change in her mental status since her
discharge. He has noted decreased p.o. intake over the last
month with the patient often refusing to eat. Upon questioning
the patient , she denies chest pain , abdominal pain , shortness of
breath , lightheadedness , and palpitations. Although , she does
answer yes and no to some questions , she is not very conversant
and does not volunteer any additional information.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy status post heart transplant in

pressure 90/60 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 96% on
room air. In general , the patient appears slightly cachetic and
is in no acute distress. She is awake and is occasionally
responding to questions but is otherwise not very conversant.
She is oriented to place. Her head and neck exam is
unremarkable. Her cardiovascular exam is notable for regular
rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no gallops , 2/6 systolic
murmur at the apex. Her JVP was noted to be 8 cm. Her lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally on a limited physical exam
( the patient is not inspiring deeply on request ). Her abdomen is
benign. Her extremities are warm with 1+ DP pulses. Her right
upper extremity graft is without thrill and without bruit.
LABORATORY DATA: Her laboratory values were notable for a BUN of
44 , creatinine 6.8 , calcium 11.2 , PTH 263 , white blood cells 6.7 ,
hematocrit 47.3 , and platelets 261.
EKG: Her EKG displayed a flutter with a 2:1 block. Her heart
rate was estimated to be at 110.
Studies: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iluminada Wiggins</PHI> had a noncontrast head CT that was notable
for widened ventricles and subarachnoid spaces. She was noted to
have extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter
changes. There was a focal lesion in the frontal lobe on the
right consistent with old infarct and unchanged from her CT scan
two months prior. There was no evidence for hemorrhage. In
general , there was no change in the CT scan when compared to her
CT scan from <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22/19.</PHI> The patient underwent a transthoracic
echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/18/19.</PHI> This TTE showed LV with a normal
size and moderate concentric LVH. Her LVEF was noted to be 55%.
There were no wall motion abnormalities. Her RV size and
function was grossly normal. Her mitral valve was noted to be
status post repair with a transmitral gradient of 4.0 mmHg.
There was trace MR. There was no change in this echocardiogram
when compared to her echocardiogram from <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/19/19.</PHI> The patient
also underwent a lumbar puncture. Her CSF was notable for an
elevated protein. Her CSF had a normal glucose , two white blood
cells with lymphocyte predominance , gram stain that did not show
any organisms , and cultures that are no growth to date. On
cytology , there were no malignant cells seen in the CSF. Her
cryptococcal antigen was negative. CSF studies that are pending
include the following: CMV culture , HSV culture , VZV culture ,
Listeria culture , HSV PCR , CMV PCR , HHV6 PCR , VZV PCR , and VDRL.
The cultures thus far have had no growth to date.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iluminada Wiggins</PHI> is a 61-year-old female with a
history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post cardiac
transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery
disease , post transplant MVR and TVR , and rejection , also with
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , hypertension and
diabetes mellitus who presented with a right upper extremity
fistula clot , new atrial flutter with 2:1 block and a change in
her mental status that has been of many months.
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: The patient is status post cardiac transplant and has
been maintained on her outpatient immunosuppressive regimen.
This includes prednisone , rapamycin , and Imuran. She has
remained euvolemic during her hospital admission.
B. Ischemia: There were no active issues , and the patient was
maintained on her outpatient regimen of aspirin , statin and
Imdur.
C. Rhythm: Electrophysiology has been seeing the patient and
has recommended medical management for her atrial flutter/atrial
fibrillation with 2:1 block. The patient's heart rate ranged
from the 80s to 120s , and she was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o.
q.i.d. She seemed to respond well to the diltiazem , although it
was hard to measure a response since the patient often refused
her medications. The patient was also maintained on metoprolol
75 mg p.o. q.i.d. It was hoped that the addition of the
diltiazem to the metoprolol would allow for the rate control of
this patient's atrial arrhythmia.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/16/19</PHI> for temporary access for hemodialysis. She was dialyzed
while in the hospital and maintained on Nephrocaps. She is
scheduled on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/23/19</PHI> for a right upper extremity venogram in
order to access her anatomy for the vascular surgeons to create
hemodialysis access.
3. Neurology/psychiatry: The patient's change in mental status
over the last few months is still of an unclear etiology. She
underwent an EEG that showed diffuse slowing that was consistent
with a toxic metabolic etiology. There was no seizure activity.
She underwent two CT scans of her head without contrast that were
negative for bleed. There were no changes in her CT scans when
compared to prior CT scan. She also underwent an LP with CSF as
mentioned above. An MRI was not completed as the patient has an
event monitor in her heart. The differential diagnosis for this
patient is changed and her mental status still includes
depression and pseudodementia , and we are still ruling out
infectious etiologies with the CSF studies that are pending at
the moment ( although this is unlikely ). It is hoped that she
will be able to follow up with neuropsychiatric testing in order
to further evaluate her change in mental status. It should be
noted that during her hospital stay , the patient's level of
interaction with the staff varied. There were days where she was
more conversant and would answer many questions appropriately.
There were also times when the patient refused to speak with
staff , appeared withdrawn and refused medications and treatments.
The son has noted that she was actually better in the hospital ,
appearing more conversant and interactive. It does not appear
that these periods of increased interaction with staff and family
were in any correlation with this patient's hemodialysis.
4. Endocrinology: The patient has type 2 diabetes on insulin at
home. She was maintained on a sliding scale of lispro with
fingersticks blood glucose before every meal and before sleeping.
Her blood sugars were in control and ranged between 110 to 240.
5. Infectious diseases: The patient has had a few low-grade
temperatures to the 100.0. An infectious workup did not yield
any etiology. She has not had an elevation in her white blood
cell count , although this may be a result of her
immunosuppression. Blood cultures from <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/14/19</PHI> yielded no
growth. Urine was not cultured , as the patient is anuric.
6. Feeding and electrolytes: The patient was hypercalcemic on
admission. This was attributed to vitamin D per the renal
fellow. Her calcium levels were followed and trended into the
normal range. She was fed a pureed and honey thick diet after
her speech and swallow evaluation indicated that the patient had
intact swallowing function.
7. GI: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease , and
she was given Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.day.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Imuran 50 mg
p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin 5000 units
subcutaneously t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 40
mg p.o. q.day , Imdur sustained release 30 mg p.o. q.day ,
Nephrocaps one tablet q.day , sliding scale of lispro insulin ,
rapamycin 8 mg p.o. q.day , Cartia XT 240 mg p.o. q.day , and
Toprol XL 300 mg p.o. q.day.
The patient was discharged to a Rehabilitation Center in stable
condition. She is to follow up with vascular surgery for a new
access for hemodialysis. It is hoped that she will follow up
with neuropsychiatric testing in order to further evaluate her
subacute change in mental status. The patient has three sons
that are very involved in her care. One of her sons is named
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iluminada Wiggins</PHI> , and his phone number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">791-288-4739.</PHI>

DIAGNOSES: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-4-07.</PHI>
AORTIC DISSECTION.
NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF TOBACCO ABUSE IN THE PAST.
HEPATITIS-C ANTIBODY POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 51 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary
artery disease with myocardial infarction in 1977 , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1977 , and myocardial infarction
in 1985 , with redo coronary artery bypass grafting at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daniel Suzette Isaacson Healthcare</PHI> , complicated by cardiogenic shock , treated with an
intra-aortic balloon pump in 1985. Since <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-05</PHI> , the patient
reported recurrent congestive heart failure with chest pain and a
variable bundle branch block requiring pacer placement with a DDD
pacer in 1990. He had an electrophysiologic study at the time ,
which was negative for ventricular tachycardia. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">12-06</PHI> , the
patient reported to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Doreen Clinic</PHI> with severe congestive heart
failure and was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> after
treatment for transplant evaluation. At <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12-14-06</PHI> , the patient's work-up included an exercise
tolerance test with oxygen uptake of 11.1 milliliters per kilogram
per minute , and a cardiac catheterization showing an essentially
open left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein grafts and
occluded native vessels. The right atrial pressure was 10 ,
pulmonary artery pressure 54/28/30 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 36 , cardiac output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440.
The echocardiogram revealed severely decreased ejection of around
15% with 2+ mitral regurgitation. Other issues included a positive
tobacco history in the past with a moderately decreased FEV-1 of
2.2 , and also hepatitis-C antibody positivity. The patient went
home after evaluation for 2 weeks and did well without fever or
chills. He did have some constipation. For 2 days , he had some
increased cough when lying down similar to his previous congestive
heart failure. The patient was readmitted on the night prior to
transplantation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-3-07</PHI> , for increasing congestive heart
failure and Dobutamine treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as
stated above. ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. SOCIAL
HISTORY revealed a 25-pack-year history of tobacco , none since
1977. He has 4 children , married. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION on
transfer included digoxin .25 milligrams by mouth each day , Pepcid
20 milligrams by mouth twice a day , captopril 25 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Lasix 80 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Ecotrin 1 by mouth each day , Coumadin , Dobutamine drip.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a somewhat cachectic male ,
comfortable with oxygen. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose and throat examination was benign. Neck was supple without
adenopathy. Lungs were clear at the tops with bibasilar crackles.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for S1 , S2 and S3 , no S4 ,
murmur or rub. Abdominal examination was benign. Extremities
showed no edema. Rectal examination revealed guaiac negative
stool , no mass.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , laboratory
values were essentially normal , except for
hyperglycemia , mildly increased liver function tests and creatinine
1.1. On admission , blood urea nitrogen was 18 , creatinine .9 ,
glucose 176 , sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , prothrombin time 13.1 ,
partial thromboplastin time 29 , calcium 8.5 , albumin 3.7 , magnesium
2 , ALT 17 , alkaline phosphatase 155 , total bilirubin 1.1.
Urinalysis was negative. Hematocrit was 38.8 , platelets 199 , 000 ,
white blood cell count 8.3. The electrocardiogram revealed AV
pacing at 90. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a pacer with
the wires in the right ventricle. An echocardiogram obtained prior
to transplantation revealed right atrial pressure 10 , pulmonary
artery 54/28/38 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 36 , cardiac
output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440 , ejection fraction
15% , 2+ mitral regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">1-4-07</PHI> , and received an orthotopic heart
transplant. This was complicated by a descending aortic dissection
from the iliac to the left subclavian vein secondary to femoral
catheterization , because the patient had had 2 previous bypasses
and would not have tolerated aortic bypass. The patient did well
postoperatively and was placed on Cyclosporine-A and prednisone.
The patient was weaned off the ventilator and Dobutamine and
diuresed without difficulty. Of note , one of the two preoperative
blood cultures grew out Clostridium perfringens. Three subsequent
blood cultures were negative , however. An Infectious Disease
Service consultation was obtained , and it was felt that intravenous
penicillin for 10 to 14 days , 30 million units every 4 hours , would
be warranted given the patient's underlying immunosuppression. The
patient underwent right ventricular biopsies according to the
protocol , and there was no evidence of rejection on any biopsies.
The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the
aortic dissection on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-11-07</PHI> , and then follow-up on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-19-07.</PHI> These
revealed a type-B dissection from the left iliac to the subclavian.
The ascending aorta was not involved. There was flow in both the
true and false lumen on both tests. The renal , SMA and ciliac
arteries were all intact. An echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-11-07</PHI> , revealed
good left ventricular function , a small amount of mitral
regurgitation , some increased pulmonary pressures and the
dissection of the aorta. The patient underwent abdominal
computerized tomography scan to rule out any occult source of
abscess which would be responsible for the Clostridium bacteremia ,
as recommended by the gastroenterology consultant. No such source
was found. The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled
with Nifedipine 3 times a day 30 milligrams , until the patient
reached the expected postoperative denervated tachycardia. After
this point , a beta blocker in the form of atenolol 25 milligrams by
mouth each day was added to decrease force on the wall of the
dissection. The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Service
from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-11-07</PHI> , and did well.
Adjustments were made in his Cyclosporine dose. He was initially
tried on some NPH insulin for hyperglycemia , but eventually with
the prednisone taper had good blood sugars on Glyburide 2.5
milligrams by mouth each day. The goal was set for the patient's
blood pressure to be kept at all times below 140 , and this was for
the most part achieved. The patient was anemic during admission ,
but postoperatively gradually his red blood cell count increased.
He was started on iron sulfate to assist in his hematologic
recovery. B12 and folate levels were normal despite polys on
stain. The patient's chest tube wounds were cultured during the
postoperative course and grew normal skin flora. They were packed
with wicks as necessary. The left groin lymph area drained clear
fluid and persisted , but had decreased substantially prior to
discharge. The patient was evaluated by the Psychiatry Service for
some features of hypomania on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-18-07.</PHI> They recommended Valium 5
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day to counter the steroid-induced
hypomania. Physical Therapy Service was active in the patient's
ambulation and felt comfortable that the patient would be able to
go home and manage on his own.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. COMPLICATIONS
included aortic dissection type B from left iliac to
left subclavian. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Cyclosporine-A 250
milligrams by mouth twice a day , Imuran 50 milligrams by mouth each
day , prednisone 25 milligrams by mouth each day , atenolol 75
milligrams by mouth each day , Glyburide 2.5 milligrams by mouth
each day , Nifedipine 30 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,
Septra-Double-Strength 1 by mouth every other day , Nystatin 15 cc
by mouth 4 times a day , iron sulfate 325 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Valium 2.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to follow a
low-saturated fat , low-cholesterol , no-added-salt diet. He will
advance his activity as tolerated. The patient was to have a
visiting nurse daily until he feels comfortable with his own care.
The visiting nurse will assist in wound dressing changes , taking
his finger sticks twice a day , taking his blood pressure and
notifying physicians for blood pressure greater than 140. They
were to check differential blood pressures between right and left
arms. The patient will also receive physical therapy assistance to
continue his progress in ambulation. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP
with the Cardiac Transplant Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-25-07</PHI> , for routine
FOLLOW-UP.

continued. She had never had the sensation before and has no h/o
tachyarrhythmia. On DOA , she came to ED for evalulation of her bilateral
gouty foot pain and was found to be tachycardic to 150 bpm. EKG notable
for narrow complex tachycardia ( SVT/likely AVNRT. )
. IN ED: given adenosine 6 mg IV x 1 with conversion to NSR for less

DOE , heart racing shortly after starting prednisone for bilateral foot
pain 2/2 gout. Found to be in SVT with rate to 150 bpm. Initially ,
high suspicion of PE , given h/o PE , evolution of pleuritic chest pain ,
and SVT. LENI's were negative. She was empirically started on heparin
IV. Yet on HD2 , she had a V/Q scan with NO perfusion defect and heparin
was discontinued. The precipitating event leading to SVT was not
determined. No PE or evidence of ischemic event. However , she had
multiple metabolic derangements , especially hyocalcemia ( Ca 6.0 , iCa
0.79 , Mg. 1.6 ) as well as evidence worsening structural heart disease and
evolving cardiomyopathy. Her SVT resolved after adenosine 12 mg IV x 1
and she remained in SR during the rest of hospital stay. ECHO showed EF
40% , diastolic dysfunction and LVH likely 2/2 longstanding HTN. This
was a change from ECHO in 2002 when she had nl EF 60% , no e/o diastolic
dysfunction and no ventricular enlargement. The cause of her new
cardiomyopathy is possibly HTN and concern raised for high-output state
due increase flow thru AV fistula. We discussed the case briefly with
the vascular surg service. There is no definitive test to determine if
flow throught the aVF is too great. This may need to be discussed between
her primary renal doctors and vascular.
.
HYPOCALCEMIA: VitD level pending , PTH dramatically elevated at 914. Noted
to have elevated QTc of QTC 504 msec in setting hypocalcemia. Calcitriol
was increased and calcium citrate was initiated. Calcium was also
repleted with calcium gluconate boluses and magnesium supplementation.
Ionized calcium was followed. She is being discharged home on Calcium
citrate bid , calcitriol 2mcg qd , and prior dose of ergocalciferol.
.
CODE: FULL
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted after experiencing a rapid heart rhythm that normalized
after treatment with medicine. There is no clear explanation for why you
went into this abnormal rhythm , there are a few possibilities. These
include disturbances in your electrolytes , such as very low calcium , as
low as changes in your heart from high blood pressure and fluid
retention. You did not have a clot to your lungs or in your legs. You
were started on calcium supplements ( calcium citrate ) , calcitriol dose
was increased. Metoprolol dose was increased to treat your high blood
pressure.
.
KEY MEDICINE CHANGES:
1. Increase metoprolol dose
2. Increase calcitriol dose
3. Start calcium citrate: takes this medicine BETWEEN meals , as it will
be less effective if taken with meals.
4. It is important that you take all prescribed medicines to keep your
heart healthy and to make sure your electrolytes and calcium stay in
acceptable limits. If you have problems filling your medicines , please
notifiy your primary or renal doctors.
.
Contact a physician or return to the emergency room if you develop
recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , sensation of rapid heart
rhythm that does not go away after a few minutes or comes on with
breathing problems or chest pain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Check metabolic panel , including calcium.
2. F/u on vitamin D level ( pending at d/c )
3. Check BP on elevated dose metoprolol ER

FIBRILLATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient was admitted <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 28</PHI> , 1996
with a history of one to two months of
stable exertional angina which became crescendo angina and an
exercise stress test , thallium , revealed multivessel disease.

his blood pressure responded with decrease to 120/72 , and his heart
rate remained in the 140 range with atrial fibrillation. He
converted to normal sinus rhythm in the eighties. He was loaded
with Digoxin and maintained on Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. That
evening , he had a second episode of atrial fibrillation. On
<PHI TYPE="DATE">February 6</PHI> , 1996 , he underwent right carotid endarterectomy for an
asymptomatic 90% stenosis. In the PACU , he had atrial fibrillation
in the 150 range with decreased blood pressure to the seventies.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 9</PHI> , 1996 , he had another episode of atrial fibrillation
lasting approximately thirty minutes which converted to normal
sinus rhythm with 5 mg of Lopressor. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 10</PHI> , 1996 , he
converted into atrial fibrillation at approximately 4 a.m. and his
blood pressure was 160/100 , his heart rate was approximately in the
130 range , and carotid sinus pressure produced no change in his
rate. An ECG revealed a supraventricular tachycardia at 130 beats
per minute , likely atrial flutter , with 2:1 conduction. Verapamil
5 mg q.5 minutes times two intravenously resulted in a heart rate
drop from 120 to 70 which revealed atrial flutter. At this point ,
he was transferred to Medicine for further management. His
medications on transfer included magnesium and potassium sliding
scale , Axid 150 p.o. b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet one to two tablets
p.r.n. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Benadryl
p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Procan
SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 9</PHI> , 1996 , and Metamucil
p.r.n. Post-transfer , he was maintained on his cardiac regimen
overnight. He remained in atrial flutter throughout the night , was
slight diaphoretic but had no other associated symptoms. He was
cardioverted electrically on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 11</PHI> , 1996 into normal sinus
rhythm with a heart rate in the seventies to nineties.
DISPOSITION: He is discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 12</PHI> , 1996 after
cardioversion in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg

cellulitis and ulceration on the anterior tibial area on the left.
The patient was placed on antibiotics and noninvasive lower
extremity demonstrated significant aorto-iliac and occlusive
disease. The patient was started on IV heparin and antibiotics
with moderate improvement in the cellulitis. The patient's
metformin was discontinued and plans were made for aorto-bi-fem
angiography. However , the patient had a cardiology work-up
including echo and Persantine-Thallium which demonstrated
significant coronary ischemia. As a result , the patient was
transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further evaluation
of his cardiac disease and for cardiac catheterization.

left upper extremities were both normal.
PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarbonate 25 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1 , glucose 173 , magnesium 1.8 ,
white blood cell count 10 , hematocrit 41.2 , hemoglobin 14.3 ,
platelets 236. PT 14.5 , INR 1.1 , PTT 32.3. Preoperative
urinalysis was normal. Cardiac catheterization performed on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06/22</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> showed stenoses in the
following coronary arteries: 70% proximal circumflex , 90% ostial
ramus , 90% proximal D1 , 90% proximal LAD and 100% ostial RCA.
There was right dominant circulation and the ventriculogram
showed 56% ejection fraction with inferior hypokinesis. EKG on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06/22</PHI> showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 71.
There are Q waves in leads III and aVF and inverted T waves in
leads I , III , aVR , aVL and V1 through V4. Chest x-ray on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06/22</PHI> shows clear lungs with mild cardiomegaly and a stable
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06/22.</PHI> He was found to have critical
coronary artery disease and was referred to the Cardiac Surgery
Service. The patient underwent a completion of a preoperative
workup and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/08/22</PHI> went to the operating room where Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Norris.</PHI> performed a CABG x5. The LIMA was used to bypass the LAD ,
the left radial artery was used to bypass the ramus , and
saphenous vein was used to bypass the OM1 , PDA and LVB1. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 145 minutes and the aortic
cross-clamp time was 116 minutes. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. On
postoperative day #1 , the patient was extubated. He complained of
right hand weakness and numbness but was otherwise recovering
very well. The Neurology Service was consulted and they suggested
that the right hand symptoms were from surgical manipulation of
the chest or positioning of the arm intraoperatively.
Occupational therapy and physical therapy were consulted to treat
the patient's right hand weakness and numbness. Otherwise , the
patient was progressing very well. He was started on Lopressor
to prevent atrial fibrillation and diltiazem for his radial
artery bypass graft. He was off all hemodynamic drips and was in
a stable rhythm with a stable blood pressure. The patient's diet
was advanced as tolerated and he was producing good urine output.
The patient was followed very closely throughout the
postoperative period by the Diabetes Management Service for high
glucose levels. On postoperative day #2 , the patient's pacer
wires and chest tubes were removed without complication. He was
ambulating and showed good postoperative progress. On
postoperative days 3 and 4 , the patient continued diuresis for
postoperative fluid retention. The patient's white blood cell
count was noted to be 13.7 and a urinalysis and urine culture
were sent. The urine culture grew greater than 100 , 000 colony
forming units of gram-negative rods and he was started on
ciprofloxacin for five-day course for postoperative urinary tract
infection. Otherwise , by postoperative #5 the patient had
progressed extremely well. He was ambulating in the halls. He
had moved his bowels and had no difficulties with urination.
He had no complaints of pain. He had remained in a sinus rhythm
with a stable blood pressure and was oxygenating well on room
air. The patient was ready for discharge home. The Diabetes
Management Service met with the patient to discuss taking insulin
at home for his poor glucose control. He agreed to take Lantus
at night and follow up with his primary care physician for future
management of his diabetes mellitus. On the morning of discharge
home , the patient's vital signs were temperature 97.7 degrees ,
heart rate 86 in the sinus rhythm , blood pressure 110/70 ,
respiratory rate 20 and O2 saturation 95% on room air. The
patient was still 5 kg above his preoperative weight and should
continue Lasix for five more days , once he is discharged home.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs on the day of discharge home. Sodium 136 ,
potassium 4.6 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 25 , creatinine 1 , BUN
23 , glucose 165 , calcium 8.2 , magnesium 2 , white blood cell count
10.6 , hemoglobin 10.5 , hematocrit 30.3 , platelets 279 , PT 15.2 ,
INR 1.2.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Discharged home with VNA Services.
DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat , 2100
calorie per day ADA diet.
ACTIVITY: The patient should be walking as tolerated and elevate
his feet with prolonged periods of sitting. The patient should
arrange followup appointments with his cardiologist Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yuko Ward</PHI> ,
at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">502-867-2131</PHI> in one to two weeks , with his primary care
physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Woodard</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">244-701-1803</PHI> in two to four weeks and
with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Emile Nathalie</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">248-037-8801</PHI> in four
to six weeks.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Acetaminophen 325 mg take one to two
tablets every four hours as needed for pain , enteric-coated
aspirin 325 mg daily , Pulmicort inhaler two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,
ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.12 h. , take 9 more doses to complete
a five-day course for postoperative urinary tract infection ,
diltiazem 15 mg p.o. t.i.d. for six weeks for the radial artery
bypass graft , Lasix 60 mg daily x5 more doses for postoperative
fluid retention , glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Motrin 600 mg p.o.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: As indicated , the patient should take Lasix
for five more days for postoperative fluid retention. The
patient should be weighed daily and the physician should be
contacted if the patient's weight , peripheral edema or work of
breathing is measurably increasing. The patient should complete
his course of ciprofloxacin for postoperative UTI. The patient's
vital signs should be monitored by the visiting nurses. In
addition his wound should be monitored for signs or symptoms of
infection. The patient was started on insulin and should follow
up with his primary care physician for future management of his
diabetes mellitus. He should be checking and documenting his
blood glucose levels with his home glucometer.

respiratory distress. HEENT , normocephalic and atraumatic ,
anicteric sclerae , mucous membranes are moist. Neck is supple
without lymphadenopathy. JVP was approximately 7-8 cm. Chest ,
she had bibasilar fine rales with fair aeration throughout. No
rhonchi or wheezes. Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , S1
and S2 with bradycardic rate at 48 beats per minute. Abdomen has
many old healed scars , no rashes , bowel sounds are positive. She
is soft , nondistended , nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities are warm and well perfused. No clubbing , cyanosis or

ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 108 , CO2 23 ,
anion gap of 9 , calcium 9 , magnesium 1.8 , total bilirubin 0.7 ,
BNP 165 , cardiac enzymes were not elevated , white count 6.91 ,
hematocrit 35.9 , platelets 227. Urinalysis was within normal
limits. PT 12.1 , PTT 43.2 , INR 1.0. A portable chest x-ray was
without any evidence of acute pulmonary process. EKG with sinus
bradycardia with rate of 55 with T-wave inversions in leads V5
and V6 , leads 1 , 2 and AVF. All present on prior EKG. There
were no acute ST changes.
EMERGENCY ROOM COURSE: Systolic blood pressure was in 190s. She
received aspirin x1 , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. x1 , Lopressor 5 mg IV
x1 , and blood pressure went down to 170s prior to her transfer to
the floor.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes.
Her EKG was abnormal , but unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/18th.</PHI> She continued on aspirin ,
Plavix and
Lipitor. Fasting lipids did not indicate need for change in
statin treatment. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/8</PHI> , the patient had a recurrence of
her chest pain symptoms in the setting of her only hypertensive
event during this admission. Her EKG was notable for new flipped
Ts in leads V3 and V4 ( which happened to be seen previously
during this admission when she had atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/4th</PHI> ). The medical team suspects
hypertensive-induced microvascular angina. A repeat rule out MI
has been re-initiated and is currently in progress at the time of
this dictation. A&amp;B set enzymes were negative.
Pump: Echocardiogram at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Padilla Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10</PHI>
revealed normal left ventricle with an EF of 60% , left atrial
enlargement , 1-2+ mitral valve regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation , and mild pulmonary hypertension ( with pulmonary
artery pressure of 43 ). The patient had fine rales on her admit
exam with BNP of 160. Of note , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Padilla Clinic</PHI> the
patient had her Lisinopril increased to 15 mg b.i.d. to facilitate
better blood pressure control. ACE inhibitor and Lasix were held
during this admission due to arise in her creatinine. Lisinopril was
restarted at a dose reduction of 5 mg b.i.d. and Lasix was restarted
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/8</PHI> in the setting of symptomatic chest pain which began while the
patient was receiving a second unit of blood ( see heme below of more
details ). Her BNP following the transfusion was 265. The current plan
is to titrate ACE inhibitor to affect as long as her creatinine
does not climb.
Rhythm: The patient had asymptomatic sinus bradycardia with rates ranging
45-58 until <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/4</PHI> when she had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response
to 130s to 140s. She was effectively treated with
Lopressor 25mg x1 , 5 mg IV x2 , then diltiazem 10 mg x1. The patient later
then converted to sinus rhythm , sinus bradycardia. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/05</PHI> , the
patient had a 12-22 symptomatic ventricular pause. The consulting
cardiologist ( Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Normand Uriarte</PHI> ) was notified of the atrial
fibrillation and ventricular pause event. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Normand Uriarte</PHI>
recommended starting an amiodarone load which has been
implemented and is currently in progress. He recommended no
inpatient EP eval this admission because the patient had no
further symptomatic pauses. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Normand Uriarte</PHI> deferring decision and
arrangements for Holter versus loop monitors to the patient's
outpatient cardiologist Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Uyeda.</PHI>
According to the prior cardiac cath reports , the patient should
be on lifelong Plavix. It is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Normand Uriarte</PHI> 's preference for
the patient to be started on thromboembolic prophylatic Coumadin
( in the setting of paroxysmals of atrial fibrillation ) and to
discontinue the aspirin because of possible bleeding risk on
combination aspirin , Plavix and Coumadin. However , he is
deferring this decision to be made by the patient's outpatient
cardiologist.
Blood Pressure: The cardiologist consultation Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Normand Uriarte</PHI> felt that the chest pain and hypertension symptoms could
be consistent with recurrence of renal artery stenosis. On
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06/22</PHI> , a Doppler renal ultrasound was notable for significant
re-stenosis of the left renal artery. The patient an
angioplasty and stent was placed without peri-procedure
complication aside from the possibility of small blood loss ( as
will be described in heme section below ).
2. Hematology: The patient has baseline hypoproliferative
normocytic normochromic anemia of chronic disease identified by
iron studies. Her B12 and folate levels were within normal
limits. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/5</PHI> , the patient had a hematocrit drop from
30-26 , but this was considered to be either a lab variant or due
to blood loss in her subcutaneous tissue from previous Lovenox
injections. Lovenox was discontinued and the team decided to use
TEDs alone for DVT prophylaxis as the patient was ambulatory. On
<PHI TYPE="DATE">1/7</PHI> , one day post-angio intervention , the patient was complaining of
lethargy. She had a post-procedure crit drop from 30-25 which the
repeat study was stable at 25. Her hemodynamics
was also stable as was her leg exam. The Angiography Team
advised that the hematocrit drop could be as result of blood loss
from recent angio intervention. The Angio Team advised that
there will be no need to pursue imaging to search for source
of blood loss unless the patient has further hematocrit drop or unless she
develops leg , abdominal and back pain symptoms. Because of the
patient's history of coronary disease , she was ordered for a 2units
a blood. She only received one unit of blood because
she was symptomatic with hypertension and chest pain when the
second bag was hung ( see cardiovascular pump section above ).
Post-transfusion hematocrit was 30.1 and was felt no further
blood would be needed.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. During
this admission , her oral agents were held and the team implemented the
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> Insulin Diabetic Protocol using NPH basal
insulin and pre-prandial aspart scales. The hemoglobin A1c was
6.8.
4. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition/renal: The patient had
essentially stable renal function during this admission. A
change in the patient's creatinine from <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/31-27/</PHI> was
attributed to medication-induced ( likely from recent lisinopril
dose increased from last <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Petronila:</PHI> admit , and/or dehydration ). Lasix was
and ACE inhibitor were both held. Lasix and ACE were both
restarted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/8</PHI> ( see cardiovascular section above ).
5. Gastrointestinal: During this admission the patient had
reported crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea. The medical team
suspects possible cause could be ischemia in the setting of
hypertension , as the patient has significant celiac disease that
was identified on an MRA obtained at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Patterson Ivette</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10.</PHI> All
stool studies were negative and as on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/07</PHI> her diarrhea
resolved.
6. MISC: After a lengthy discussion with the patient , she opted to be a
DNI otherwise wanted all other resuscitative measures.
IMPRESSION: This is an 82-year-old female who presents with
complaints of intermittent lightheadedness and sudden onset of
severe chest and abdominal pressure in the setting of
hypertensive urgency with documented blood pressure of 194/74.
Her symptoms resolved with blood pressure control. The medical
team suspects that:
1. The cause of the patient's episodic lightheadedness prompting
multiple visits to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Padilla Clinic</PHI> may be from atrial
fibrillation with RVR and/or ventricular pauses. Additional
workup for this can be pursued by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Uyeda.</PHI> as an outpatient.
2. Given the significant history of vascular disease and the
findings on recent MRA , the team suspects that the patient may
have hypertension-induced gut ischemia and microvascular cardiac
angina.
This is preliminary discharge summary and the discharge addendum
including discharge medications , final diagnoses and medical
followup will need to be dictated at the time of discharge.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN OF UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">CWZSN</PHI> is a 72 year old woman
with a past medical history
significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension
who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath.
She had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise
stress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic ST-T wave
changes. She had a catheterization at that time which revealed
diffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant. In
1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her EKG but it was not
clear when exactly this happened. She stated that for the past
year , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest that
then progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations. Sometimes ,
there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position
and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past
two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three
times a week and was associated with shortness of breath. Two days
prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to
her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb. She was quite
short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or
medication noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant also for diabetes for which she
took insulin and checked her sugars at home
which ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she had
idiopathic drop attacks. She got these episodes where her legs
fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose
consciousness. She had had an MRI/MRA that showed some diffuse
small vessel disease but the MRA was normal.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10
q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash and intravenous contrast dye
caused hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She was a retired nurses' aide who retired in
1992 , she was a widow , and she had two living
children who were grown. She lived alone and took care of her
eight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law who
lived next door.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderly
obese African-American woman lying in bed in
some mild respiratory distress. Her oropharynx was moist , her
jugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered crackles
at the bases , her heart was regular with an S4 , her belly was soft
and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal
examination showed guaiac negative brown stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a left bundle branch block
and chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary
edema and Kerley B lines. Her laboratories on admission were all
within normal limits. Her initial CK was 97 with troponin of 0.01.
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 72 year old woman with multiple
cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of
unclear etiology. She was admitted for evaluation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - She was admitted for
catheterization which showed three vessel
disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the
catheterization in 1997. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She had an echo which showed some element of diastolic
dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus RA
but no wall motion abnormalities. It was felt that she had some
element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit
of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia. Therefore ,
while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood
pressure regimen was advanced. Her heart rate was in the fifties
to sixties and Atenolol 50 b.i.d. was added. She was on a maximum
of Lisinopril at 40 milligrams so nifedipine extended release was
added and titrated up to 120 milligrams q.d. where she maintained
systolic blood pressures in the 160 range nevertheless. This could
be further titrated as an outpatient.
2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately
four liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously and
would be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d.
for further diuresis.
3. Pulmonary - She did have hypoxia on admission to 85% on room
air while lying in bed. This was felt to be out of proportion to
her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought.
Her D-dymer was greater than 1000 and she then went for a V/Q scan
which was low probability. Her lower extremity noninvasives were
negative. She also had a chest CT which showed no interstitial
lung disease. She had pulmonary function tests which were
consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from
her pulmonary function tests in 1998. A pulmonary consultation was
obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with
obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of
her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of
breath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% on
room air.
4. Endocrine - She was maintained on metformin during admission
and also on half of her dose of her normal dose of NPH given her
decreased p.o. intake , however , given the fact that she stated that
her sugars at home on her regimen of 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. were
170 to 200 , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions to
check her sugar and call her doctor if they were low.
DISPOSITION: She is discharged in stable condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 2</PHI> ,
2000. She will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">WQUWN</PHI> , her primary
care doctor , and in addition , with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Normand Uriarte</PHI> , her cardiologist.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , nifedipine
extended release 120 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24
q.p.m. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , aspirin 325 q.d. , and Lasix 20
milligrams p.o. q.d. times seven days.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/12/2906</PHI>
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ORAL HERPES.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old man with
a longstanding history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure who was originally
admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/0l/9l</PHI> with worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion
for augmentation of cardiac function. He was well until l96l when
he initially presented with left bundle-branch block , left
ventricular hypertrophy , and transient chest pain. He then had
high grade ventricular ectopic activity in l972 treated with
Quinaglute. Subsequently from l972 to l988 , examination was
notable for worsening left ventricular function. In l988 , he had
recurrent frequent congestive heart failure and underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed an enlarged hypokinetic ventricle with
an ejection fraction of around 32%. His coronary arteries showed
acute marginal of 70% stenosis and 40% of the mid circumflex. In
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/04</PHI> , his ejection fraction by right ventriculogram was 20%. In
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7/05</PHI> , he had atypical pneumonia followed by recurrent congestive
heart failure. Subsequent course was notable for dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. He was
treated with Lasix , Zaroxolyn , Captopril , and Quinaglute. In
<PHI TYPE="DATE">l0/90</PHI> , he was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for
worsening symptoms , weight gain , and creatinine of 2.9. He was
managed with decreased Lasix , increased Captopril , and ultimately
decided to treate with Lasix and Zaroxolyn. He was then placed on
the Cardiac Transplant List and underwent transplant evaluation.
Exercise tolerance test showed 8 minutes and 43 seconds bicycle
with O2 uptake of l2. Right heart catheterization showed wedge
pressure of 25. PPD was negative and abdominal ultrasound was
negative. Echo showed global left ventricular dysfunction , apical
thrombus , mild tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral
regurgitation. Cholesterol was l53 , l-2 immunoglobulins within
normal limits , and toxo was plus IgG and minus IgM. He had
negative hepatitis , histo , blasto , or coccidiomycosis. CMV showed
borderline IgG and negative IgM and EBV showed positive IgG and
negative IgM. Since his discharge in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , he has noted
worsening of symptoms with decreased exercise tolerance and
increased orthopnea.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ended up being
started on Dobutamine and had gradually declining
course during his admission culminating in having a cardiac
transplant when a heart became available. This occurred on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">04/23/9l.</PHI> His post-operative course was uncomplicated and his
subsequent course was complicated only by acute worsening of his
renal function associated with high Cyclosporin levels with the
Cyclosporin held and the level allowed to come down. His renal
function returned to baseline. He also developed an oral herpes
lesion. He subsequently did very well post-operatively. Multiple
right ventricular biopsies were negative for rejection. On biopsy
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/3</PHI> , his wedge pressure was l8 , right atrial pressure l3 ,
right ventricular 48/l4 , and PA pressure of 48/24. He tolerated
slow taper of his steroids without event and it was noted that he
had some tremor also post-operatively which was attributed to
Cyclosporin toxicity. Other than that , his post-operative course
was uncomplicated.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/08/9l.</PHI> He is
to have follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ingram.</PHI> as well as Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Updegraff.</PHI>
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Persantine 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Clotrimazole

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CHEST PAIN , FOR RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES
3. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
4. HYPERTENSION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old , Spanish
speaking woman with multiple cardiac
risk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. The
patient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,
previous history of smoking as well as postmenopausal state
secondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogen
replacement therapy. The patient has a two to three year history
of exertional angina. Of note , approximately one year ago she
began to have substernal chest pain at rest. The patient states
that currently she is having approximately three episodes a day on
average. She describes these as substernal chest pressure which
radiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. She denies any
associated shortness of breath but does occasionally note
diaphoresis. She denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram which
showed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction of
approximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild
tricuspid regurgitation. Since this time she has been followed by
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hazel Latonya</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> Clinic who initiated an antianginal regimen
which resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. Of note the
patient recently stopped taking Aspirin. Her symptoms then
recurred. On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">13th of May</PHI> , 1995 the patient underwent a
Dobutamine MIBBE on which she went 6 minutes and 48 seconds
reaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.
The test showed 2 mm ST depressions diffusely. The MIBBE showed
moderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wall
ischemia. Of note , on the morning of admission the patient was
seen by her VNA. During her VNA's visit the patient began to have
her typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw as
well as shortness of breath. She denied any diaphoresis or nausea.
The patient was given three sublingual Nitroglycerins after her
primary M.D. was called and her pain resolved after approximately
15 minutes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for a 10 year
history of Insulin dependent diabetes with complications including
neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic atrial fibrillation included a
normal TSH. Hypertension. Degenerative joint disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux. Status post hysterectomy approximately 21
years ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
which the patient recently stopped , Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopipd 600
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Insulin , NPH , 75 units sub-q
q.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure
141/73 , O-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters ,
respiratory rate 16 and unlabored. HEENT exam showed pupils equal
round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact.
Oropharynx was clear. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck was
supple with full range of motion. Jugular venous pressure was
difficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around the
neck. Carotids were 2+ and without bruits. Cardiac exam showed an
irregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal S-1 and S-2 , a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , obese with active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a
right shin scar which was healing well. There was no clubbing or
cyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. Rectal examination
was guaiac negative. On neurologic examination the patient was
alert and oriented x 2. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.
Strength was 5/5 bilaterally. There was decreased sensation to
light touch bilaterally in the lower extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission Sodium 134 , Potassium 4.7 , Chloride
96 , Bicarb 22 , BUN 28 , Creatinine 1.3 , Blood
Glucose 472 , Digoxin level 1.0. PT 14.5 , PTT 26. Urinalysis was
negative. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 with a
normal axis. T wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and F
and Q waves were noted in V-1 through V-3. Chest x-ray showed no
evidence of infiltrates or effusions. There was borderline
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Medicine Team <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</PHI>
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with
serial CK , MB and EKG's. Heparin was initially started given the
possibility that this was unstable angina. The Cardiology Team was
consulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.
On further review of her history the Cardiology Team decided to
schedule a cardiac catheterization. This was performed on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">19th of May</PHI> and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including a
right atrial pressure of 15 , an RV pressure of 50/16 with a mean PA
pressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. The coronary
arteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function was
also assessed as normal. The patient tolerated this procedure well
and without complications. Given the confluence of her data , two
possible explanations were postulated including either syndrome X
or small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. The
patient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization and
was prepared for discharge. Also during her hospital course the
patient's Insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep her
blood sugars in the approximately 200 range.

ALLERGIES: Penicillin and sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco , alcohol , or IV drug
use. She has two children and lives alone since hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 99.2 , pulse 89 ,
blood pressure 130/86 , respiratory rate 20 , and oxygen saturation
100% on room air. General , the patient is in no acute distress ,
but is unable to talk with the trach tube currently in place.
HEENT , mucous membranes are moist and there are no OP lesions.
Neck , JVP is not appreciated due to the patient's body habitus.
Cardiovascular , heart rate is regular , regular rhythm , no
murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Chest , decreased breath sounds in all
fields with a prolonged expiratory phase. Abdomen , bowel sounds
are present , abdomen is obese , nontender , and there is a G tube
in place. Extremities , no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
Extremities are obese. Skin , no rashes or bruises. Neurologic ,
no cranial nerve , sensory , or motor deficits noted. Gait is
deferred.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION: The patient's CBC reveals a
hematocrit of 29.2 , which is consistent with her baseline of 28
to 30. Her CBC , chem-7 , and LFTs are all unremarkable.
PROCEDURES:
1. Trach tube change - the patient's tracheostomy tube was
changed to a Custom #6 Bivona on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16/20</PHI> by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LSUUZ</PHI> ( Surgery ).
2. Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12/20</PHI> and
revealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx ,
compromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissue
was noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared to
potentially compromise the airway.
3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow was
performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16/20</PHI> , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk.
The patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to the
General Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Over
the course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodged
on numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery or
respiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube.
However , the patient remained stable throughout these events with
a pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when the
tube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6
Bivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LSUUZ</PHI> ( General Surgery ) inserted this tube
without incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once the
tube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizer
therapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and the
patient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92%
on trach mask oxygen.
2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , the
patient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibile
decannulation. However , this procedure revealed
excessive tissue in her upper oropharynx and
what appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of this
finding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue could
compromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore ,
the patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of her
upper airway. Throughout this hospital
course , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able to
use a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to use
one with her trach tube in place.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of
recurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patient
underwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possible
aspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficulty
during this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended the
patient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluid
restrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , the
patient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although these
may be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slater Laura</PHI> , General Surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: On discharge , the patient's
temperature was 97.8 , pulse 81 , blood pressure 122/84 ,
respiratory rate 22 , and oxygen saturation 100% on supplemental
oxygen of 30% by trach mask. General , no acute distress ,
pleasant , obese woman. HEENT , mucous membranes are moist.
Pupils are round. Extraocular movements are intact. Neck , JVP
could not be assessed. Chest , distant breath sounds with
occasional wheezes , but no appreciable crackles or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular , S1 and S2 intact , regular , but distant heart
sounds. Abdomen is obese , soft , and nontender , positive bowel
sounds , without appreciable masses. Extremities are obese , but
without edema.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/14/2911</PHI>
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATYPICAL ANGINA AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 76 year old male with
increased anginal symptoms for
approximately one month post-PTCA. This patient had known
multivessel coronary artery disease status post angioplasty
admitted with six hours of rest chest pain with non-diagnostic EKG
changes and initial troponin and CK negative. Patient's risk
factors include a history of hypertension , prior history of
tobacco , non-insulin dependent diabetes , his age , and sex. In
<PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1995 , the patient developed his first symptoms of cardiac
angina. He was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10/10</PHI> with chest pain at rest and
minimal EKG changes. CK initially was 210 and MB was not done.
Patient did not rule in. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12/10</PHI> , the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization with elevated right atrial pressure of 39
and 14 , mildly elevated , and three vessel disease with 70% proximal
stenosis of his left anterior descending artery , 90% apical
stenosis with 30% stenosis of the left circumflex , and two serial
95% stenoses distally of the left circumflex noted. His first
diffuse marginal branch had 30% to 40% diffuse luminal irregularity
in his right coronary artery. Posterior descending artery was
noted to have a 90% mid stenosis. Systolic function was normal
with ejection fraction of 71%. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12/10</PHI> , the patient had a
balloon angioplasty of the proximal and 95% stenosis of his left
circumflex artery. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/15/10</PHI> , the patient continued to complain
of chest pressure. He underwent exercise tolerance test. He went
five minutes and one second stopping secondary to leg fatigue with
a 2 mm ST segment depression. He underwent cardiac catheterization
with angioplasty of his mid posterior descending artery with 30%
residual stenosis and a small dissection of the inferior margin of
the vessel. He was discharged home aspirin , Lisinopril , Atenolol ,
Micronase , and enoxaparin. Patient was well at home until the day
of his admission when he had retrosternal chest pressure of 10/10
at approximately 6 p.m. He took three sublinguals without relief
and presented to the Emergency Room with 5/10 chest pressure. In
the Emergency Room , he had some relief of his chest pressure with
sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous nitroglycerin brought
significant relief. He had non-diagnostic EKG changes but was
admitted to the CCU for concern for unstable anginal pattern.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for C4-C5 radiculopathy with
steroid injection for pain control , inguinal
hernia , and benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral
resection of the prostate.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 q.d. , Lisinopril
7.5 q.d. , Atenolol 75 q.d. , Micronase 5 q.d. ,
and enoxaparin 60 mg q.12h.
ALLERGIES: Patient was allergic to penicillin with a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was in no acute
distress with a heart rate of 54 , blood
pressure 114/78 , respiratory rate 18 , and saturation 97% on four
liters. On 100 micrograms of nitroglycerin and Heparin , there was
no chest discomfort. HEENT: Benign. LUNGS: Few basilar
crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination showed bradycardia with
II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and apex.
ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a potassium
of 3.9 , hematocrit of 37.1 , troponin of 0 ,
and CK initially of 121. EKG revealed a sinus bradycardia with
normal intervals , normal axis , and no new change as compared to old
EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Assessment was that this was basically a 76 year
old with known coronary artery disease presenting
with unstable angina with no significant troponin or CK values.
Given his history of recent intervention and coronary artery
disease , this appeared consistent with unstable angina. The
patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with his CK flat
and repeat troponin of 0. He was continued on intravenous Heparin
and nitroglycerin in the interval amount of time until he ruled out
and his aspirin therapy was decreased down to 81 with simvastatin
started. Patient received repeat catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/11/11</PHI> which
revealed 50% stenosis at the mid left circumflex at the PTA site ,
30% to 40% stenosis of the distal posterior descending artery at
the PTA site , 40% proximal left anterior descending , 95% distal
left anterior descending at the apex , and 70% distal left
circumflex giving rise to two PLV branches. The plan was that the
patient would get a distal left circumflex PTCA tomorrow when there
would be surgical back-up available. The patient was continued on
intravenous Heparin and nitroglycerin overnight without any
recurrent chest discomfort. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/12/11</PHI> , the patient had PTCA
times three at the mid left circumflex 50% to 60% stenosis
ballooned to 30% , distal left circumflex 80% stenosis was ballooned
to 30% residual , and distal left anterior descending with 90%
stenosis ballooned to 20% residual. Post-PTCA , the patient was
continued on Heparin overnight without any recurrent chest
discomfort. There was a issue with this patient of whether his
chest discomfort given its atypical nature was cardiac in etiology
although he definitely had disease on angiography but he had
significant possibility for other etiologies as a source for his
discomfort such as cervical radiculopathy with left arm numbness
and occasional anterior chest discomfort which he had difficulty
distinguishing from any anginal-like discomfort. He also had a
history of gastrointestinal distress with frequent gaseousness.
The patient was basically observed 24 hours after his Heparin was
stopped , he was restarted on enoxaparin , and continued on aspirin ,
Captopril , Lopressor , and simvastatin. Patient did not have any
recurrent chest discomfort in the interim observation and he was
discharged home on a stable out-patient regimen. Additional
in-house issues included that gastrointestinally , patient was
continued on Prilosec and Maalox therapy for his gaseousness and
gastrointestinal distress. Given the crackles on examination , he
had a chest x-ray which was negative for any infiltrate and he
required some O2 supplementation initially when he presented but he
was weaned off O2 prior to discharge. As far as his diabetes , he
continued on his out-patient Micronase with b.i.d. fingerstick
monitoring which was normal. Fluids , electrolyte , and nutrition
wise , his potassium and magnesium were kept optimally repleted
given his cardiac history.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Micronase 5 mg q.d. ,
Lisinopril 2.5 mg q.d. , and sublingual nitroglycerin.
FOLLOW-UP: Patient is to schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Linda , Yamane Izaguirre</PHI> for cardiac follow-up. The plan was that
he would call Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Linda , Yamane Izaguirre</PHI> for follow-up.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure exacerbation ,
pneumonia.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED DURING THIS
ADMISSION: Bronchoalveolar cancer , atrial fibrillation ,
hypertension , hypothyroidism , mitral valve repair , and chronic
renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">IWGLN</PHI> is a 75-year-old female
with past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure with an EF of 30% , mitral valve
repair in <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/2921</PHI> , lung cancer likely stage IIIB , and atrial
fibrillation , who was recently discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/08/2921</PHI> after
being admitted for acute renal failure and chronic renal failure
and hyperkalemia. Since being discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/08/2921</PHI> , the
patient reported that she had been doing well until the date of
admission when she noticed a 2.5-pound weight gain , increased
shortness of breath with activity and increased oxygen
requirement during the day. She reports that she normally uses 2
liters of oxygen at night , however , she was needing the oxygen
during the day. She also reports 2 episodes of substernal chest
pain which occurred at rest. There was no radiation , no nausea ,
vomiting , or diaphoresis. These episodes of chest pain lasted 3
or 4 minutes and resolved with nitroglycerin sublingual. The
patient also noted that she had been urinating very much , does
report she had been taking all of her medications as directed at
discharge. She thus called her primary cardiologist , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Weston Noelle</PHI> , who instructed her to get labs drawn. She was found to
have potassium of 5.4 and a creatinine of 2.3 and thus was told
to report to the ED.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied any fever , chills , nausea
or vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , or rashes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , she is status
post PCI to OM1 in 1991 , LAD was stented in 1997 , left circumflex
was stented in 2001 , and the right coronary artery was stented in
2002; history of dyslipidemia; history of CHF with an EF of
30%-35% , she has a dry weight of 158 pounds; hypertension , mitral
valve repair in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/2006;</PHI> atrial fibrillation for which she is
rate controlled and is on Coumadin; history of renal artery
stenosis , she is status post a left renal artery stent; chronic
renal insufficiency , she has a baseline creatinine of 1.9 to 2.2;
GERD; peripheral vascular disease; iron deficiency anemia;
bronchoalveolar lung cancer , she is status post a right upper
lobe and right lower lobe wedge resections. Also , history of
uterine cancer , she is status post a TAH-BSO , hypothyroidism , and
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Torsemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg
once a day , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Ativan 0.5 mg twice a day
as needed , Colace 100 mg twice a day , Coumadin 1 mg by mouth in
the evening , ferrous sulfate 325 by mouth twice a day , glipizide
5 mg by mouth twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Levoxyl 100 mcg p.o. daily , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , Nexium
20 daily , pravastatin 40 mg each evening , and Toprol 100 mg by
mouth daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: She had a temperature of
97.3 , pulse of 80 , blood pressure 146/76 , and respiratory rate of
16. O2 saturation of 96% on room air. HEENT: She had moist
mucous membranes. Her oropharynx was clear. She had a left
pupil which was enlarged and nonreactive secondary to that being
a surgical eye. Right eye was reactive. She had no
lymphadenopathy. Lungs: left side was clear to
auscultation. The right side had decreased breath sounds at the
base , few crackles at the right base. Cardiovascular
Examination: She had irregularly irregular rhythm. She had a
normal S1 , S2 , did not have any murmurs , rubs , or gallops and was
found to have a flat JVP on admission. Abdominal Examination:
She had positive bowel sounds , she was soft , nontender ,
nondistended. She did not have any hepatomegaly. Extremities:
She was warm and well perfused. Distal pulses were not palpable.
She did have trace edema , left greater than right which was
chronic. She was alert and oriented x3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Pulmonary/Oncology: The patient was admitted in stable condition
and was requiring 2 liters of oxygen to keep her saturations in
the mid 90s. She had a chest x-ray which showed a right pleural
effusion. Review of previous imaging done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/29/2921</PHI>
demonstrated an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe ,
which was surrounded by a right pleural effusion of moderate
size. The patient also had a PET scan in early <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , which
showed that the consolidation lit up extensively. Review of
these studies prompted consideration of possible pneumonia versus
a bronchioalveolar carcinoma spread. Pulmonary was consulted and
they suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possible
postobstructive pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin ,
vancomycin , and Flagyl on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/13/2921.</PHI> She received 7 days of
these antibiotics while in hospital. On day 4 of her
hospitalization , a thoracentesis was performed for both
diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. The pleural fluid
demonstrated a transudative picture. Gram stain was negative.
Cultures did not grow anything. Cytology , preliminary read was
negative. She had 50 white blood cells and 2000 red blood cells
approximately 800 mL were removed and the patient felt much less
short of breath following the thoracentesis requiring much less
oxygen. A followup CT scan was obtained , which showed continued
infiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural
effusion , no pneumothorax was observed. Radiology felt that her
consolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and that
it was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in fact
quite patent and thus it was decided that the patient would
continue a 14-day course of levofloxacin with followup with
pulmonary to consider whether or not a bronchoscopy would be
indicated for further workup of this patient's infiltrate with
followup imaging to occur as well.
Cardiovascularly , for this patient , ischemia wise , the patient
did have 2 episodes of chest pain prior to admission. She did
not have any EKG changes. Two sets of cardiac markers were
obtained which were both negative , thus assumed that she did not
have ischemic event that occurred. She was continued on her
aspirin and pravastatin while inhouse. Pump wise , the patient
has a diagnosis of CHF with an EF of 30%. She presented
approximately 2 kg above her dry weight. She was continued on
her home dose of torsemide 40 b.i.d. and also on the isosorbide
dinitrate although this was increased to 10 mg t.i.d. , she was
also started on hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. and did diurese
approximately 500 mL to 1 liter each day. She returned to her
dry weight and on the day of discharge , has a weight of 72.6 kg ,
had been admitted with a dry weight of 74.9 kg. Rhythm wise , the
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. She was rate
controlled with her metoprolol 37.5 mg daily. Her Coumadin was
continued except for brief period during which it was held prior
to the tap of this. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.
Endocrine wise , this patient's fingersticks were well controlled.
She was put on a course of Lantus and NovoLog q.a.c. sliding
scale as needed. Fingersticks were maintained within a normal
range. Her Levoxyl was 100 mcg daily , was continued and her
allopurinol 100 mg daily was continued for her history of gout.
On discharge , she is being put back on her glipizide for the
diabetes.
Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition. The patient came in
hyperkalemic. She was given Kayexalate 30 mg x1 in the emergency
room to which she responded and had a normal potassium throughout
her hospital stay.
Renal. For this , the patient with her diuresis she did and with
the addition of the hydralazine , she did have her creatinine drop
from 2.2 down to 1.7 during her hospital admission on the day of
discharge , it was 1.9 , which is within her baseline for her
chronic renal insufficiency.
Hematology wise , the patient had a stable hematocrit in the low
30s. She was continued on her iron 325 twice a day for her iron
deficiency anemia. LENI's also performed and showed no evidence of DVT.
On the day of discharge , notable findings on physical exam , she
was afebrile. Heart rate was 71 to 85. Blood pressure 100-114
over 40-66. She was saturating 93% to 97% on room air.
Cardiovascular Examination: She was irregularly irregular. S1 ,
S2 were present. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Her
JVP was noted to be 9 cm. Examination of her lungs revealed that
they were clear to auscultation on the left. On the right , she
had crackles approximately halfway up , but did not have decreased
breath sounds as noted on admission. She did not have any
pitting edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , allopurinol 100 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg twice a day , ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice a
day , glipizide 5 mg twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg 3
times a day , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , Toprol XL 100 mg daily ,
Coumadin 1 mg q.p.m. , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , pravastatin 40
mg daily , torsemide 40 mg twice a day , Nexium 20 mg daily ,
levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth , q.48h. for a total course of 4 more
doses , hydralazine 10 mg 3 times a day , Ativan 0.5 mg as needed.
DISPOSITION: The patient was in stable condition.
PENDING TESTS: Final pathology report on the cytology studies
from her thoracentesis is still pending.
FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has an appointment scheduled with
her primary care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Isbell Nathan.</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/2/2921.</PHI>

ALLERGIES:
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 96.2 degrees Fahrenheit. His heart rate was
62 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 170/72. His
oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. He was awake and alert
and in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure was
approximately 12 cm of water. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border. He did not have any signs of pulses
paradoxes. His lungs had decreased breath sounds at the right
base with rales at the left base. His abdomen was soft and
distended but nontender. There were normoactive bowel sounds.
The extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally at the shins.
His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
His sodium was 134 and his potassium was 3.4. His chloride was
100 and his bicarb was 21. His BUN was 140 and his creatinine
was 7.0. His white blood cell count was 8.4 and his hematocrit
was 26.1. His INR was 2.5. His calcium was 9.0. His EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 61 beats per minute. This was
a paced rhythm. His chest x-ray showed volume overload and
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: On admission , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> had significant volume
overload with weight gain , edema , and chest x-ray evidence of
pulmonary edema. He also had significant azotemia with a BUN of
140. His creatinine had also increased from his baseline
creatinine of 5.0 to 7.0 at admission. His physical examination
the morning after admission showed worsening somnolence and slow
asterixis with jerky myoclonic movements. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/09/20</PHI> , the
tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed in his right internal
jugular vein by interventional radiology. This procedure was
tolerated without complication. Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> had his first run of
hemodialysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/10/20</PHI> , which he tolerated well with subsequent
improvement in his mental status and resolution of his asterixis.
He again underwent hemodialysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/11/20</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/14/20</PHI> and
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/16/20.</PHI> In addition , he underwent a two-hour run of
ultrafiltration on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/17/20</PHI> with removal of nearly four liters of
fluid. Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> will continue with intermittent hemodialysis
on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday schedule after discharge from
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> . Plans are underway for Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI>
to have an AV fistula placed. He has a follow-up appointment on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/23/20</PHI> with vascular surgery at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> .
2. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> was maintained
on a renal diet. He was started on Nephrocaps multivitamin. On
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/10/20</PHI> , he was started on Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. for a phosphorus
level of 5.8. However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/17/20</PHI> , his phosphorus level was 1.8
and therefore his Phoslo was held.
3. Cardiovascular: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> has a long history of
hypertension and he is treated with multiple medications. His
systolic blood pressures have ranged in the 160-180s during this
admission. He was continued on his Norvasc and labetolol. He
was also continued on hydralazine at 100 mg t.i.d. In addition ,
lisinopril was added and titrated to 10 mg p.o. daily. In
addition , he was continued on his clonidine at 0.6 mg b.i.d. Mr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Henrietta</PHI> blood pressure did not return to a normal level after he
was dialyzed repeatedly. His blood pressure will need to be
continued to be monitored at rehab with potentially additional
medicines added. In addition , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> has a history of
coronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation MI. He was
initially due to be discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/14/20</PHI> , but shortly after
hemodialysis , he had one 15-minute episode of sharp left-sided
chest pain. He was therefore ruled out for myocardial infarction
with serial enzymes and EKGs. He showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.
4. Hematology: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> is maintained on Coumadin for history
of deep venous thrombosis. When he was first admitted , his
Coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled
hemodialysis catheter. He received one oral dose of vitamin K as
well as fresh frozen plasma prior to placement of the line. He
was subsequently restarted on his Coumadin and it was titrated
while being treated with antibiotics. His previous dose was 4 mg
and he will be discharged on that dose.
5. Endocrine: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> has a history of diabetes mellitus and
was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Infectious Disease: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> became febrile to 101 degrees
Fahrenheit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/15/20.</PHI> He was again febrile on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/16/20.</PHI> His
urine culture grew out enterobacter cloacae , which was
subsequently found to be pan resistant. Prior to his
sensitivities being obtained , he was treated with levofloxacin.
When it was determined that the enterobacter was resistant to
levofloxacin , he was switched to gentamicin 60 mg IV x1 on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/17/20.</PHI> He should receive several additional days of
gentamicin approximately five or six days. He should be dosed
after hemodialysis for a gentamicin level less than 5. Mr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> did have one positive blood culture from <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/15/20</PHI> that
grew out gram-positive cocci in clusters at the time of this
dictation. There was only one out of four bottles that grew out
these gram-positive cocci. He did receive one dose of vancomycin
in the early morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/17/20.</PHI> It was felt that this blood
culture most likely represented a contaminant. All of his other
blood cultures remained negative at the time of this dictation.
DISPOSITION:
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gene Hipolito Giovanni</PHI> will be discharged to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanhorn Harper Gabriela.</PHI> His
blood pressure and INR will need to be monitored. He will
continue on hemodialysis three times per week. He has an
appointment at vascular surgery on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/23/20</PHI> to plan for AV
fistula formation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
He was afebrile. He was alert and conversational. He had
occasional rales at his bases. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur at his left sternal border.
His abdomen had normoactive bowel sounds , it was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended. His extremities were warm and there was no
edema. He showed no signs of uremia with no asterixis.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/17/2910</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY
2. ASTHMA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41 year old
Afro-American woman who has the
diagnosis of inferior wall myocardial infarction on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/6/10</PHI>
transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Blair Clinic</PHI> for postmyocardial infarction
angina.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension , smoking , family history of
coronary artery disease , and CVA. No
diabetes. She is not postmenopausal , no history of elevated
cholesterol. No previous myocardial infarction history.
Two and a half weeks prior to admission while sorting mail , she had
20 minutes of Cushing substernal chest pressure , increased
shortness of breath with diaphoresis and radiation down the left
arm and across to the right chest. Initially , she thought she had
gastrointestinal distress. Pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours after
eating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable if
affected by position. There were no EKG changes. In the intervening
period she had several additional episodes of this pain and
presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CHCE</PHI> where she was treated with Disalcid and Tagamet.
The pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/6/10</PHI> when she
presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CHCE</PHI> with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chest
pressure. She was sent to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Blair Clinic</PHI> where she ruled in for
myocardial infarction with a CK equal to 1508 MB fractions. MB of
126 with a peak of 1900 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/6.</PHI> EKG demonstrated Q waves in 3 and
ADF. T waves aversions of 2 ST segment depressions in V2 through
V5. She was treated with IV nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,
diltiazem , Metoprolol and aspirin. She apparently had additional
pain while on this regimen and was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI> for catheterization and management.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications as an outpatient were only
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. Upon transfer her
medications included Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once a
day , Diltiazem CD 240 mg once a day , Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , IV
nitroglycerin , IV heparin , and Percocet for pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies , but has an allergy to seafood
- she gets hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery disease and
cerebrovascular accident in the early 40's in both
her father and mother.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She smokes one pack a day of cigarettes for the
past 20 years with occasional alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit at
the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI> is notable
for a blood pressure of 130/85 , the pulse is 79 , respiratory rate
of 16 to 20 on three liters of 100% face mask. HEENT exam -
sclerae are anicteric , pupils equal and reactive to light ,
extraocular movements are intact , oropharynx were clear. There were
no carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. Chest -
there was a poorly healed scar on the anterior chest. Lungs were
clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. No CVA
tenderness. Cardiac exam - PMI nondisplaced , regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 , split S2. There is a 2 out of 6 whooshing
crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border that radiates to the apex. There was an S4. Abdomen - obese
with a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. No
hepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses are intact with a right bruit.
Extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Reflexes were intact. Toes were
downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for potassium of 3.8 , a white
blood cell count of 13.6 , hematocrit of
37.8 , platelets of 179 , magnesium 2.3 and CK of 201 , PT-PTT 13.2 ,
59 with an INR of 1.2. Urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 white
blood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+
leukocyte esterase. There were no effusions or evidence of failure
on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for
an inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing
postmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina
versus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support
this. In the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">DHHX</PHI> she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,
aspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IV
nitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled for
a catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer with
pretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfish
allergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/9/10</PHI>
with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,
pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM
( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive with
good distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries were
deemed normal. On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">10th of December</PHI> , the patient was transferred
out of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note ,
postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruit
on the right which was there prior to catheterization. An
echocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%
with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the
<PHI TYPE="DATE">10th of December</PHI> , the patient was noted to have a white blood cell
count of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T wave
inversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG's from
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/9.</PHI> The patient's MI was felt to be consistent with a lesion
from the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at this
time that the increased white blood cell count was most likely
secondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior to
catheterization. The patient's does of Lopressor was increased to
75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. She was
continued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin and
continued on cardiac monitor. On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">11th of December</PHI> , the patient
had an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left
arm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight
diaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was being
weaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse
of 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new
murmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be a
sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and R
which were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2
which were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given one
sublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up.
She was likewise given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor for recontrol and
Serax 15 mg x one. Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 with
these interventions with no radiation in the arm. She described it
as a heaviness. Blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. EKG at
this point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. T
wave inversions in 3R ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 , V3 , V5
with T wave sinusoidality and V6 T wave slightly inverted. IV
nitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was divided
and oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. Patient was
pain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg IV Lopressor
was given for better late recontrol. Duration of total episode was
approximately 20 minutes. The pain-free EKG was notable for a rate
of 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T wave
upright , else no change. The IV TNG was dialed up further for a
blood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. A second bolus of IV
morphine was obtained at this time. CK and Isoenzymes were sent
and Cardiology attending was made aware. The patient was made NPO
in case of any need for catheterization the following morning if
symptoms were to recur. The CK following this event was magnified
with a triponin I of 14.1. On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">11th of December</PHI> it was deemed
appropriate to continue with the IV heparin one more day and
control symptoms with IV nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were to
increase , it was still deemed appropriate to considering this
patient for recurrent cath. On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">12th of December</PHI> , the patient
returned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%
distal left circumflex stenosis. There was a PTCA performed of this
distal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. A stent was
placed in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.
The lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%
stenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in the
proximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for a
total of three stents in place in the left circumflex. EKG's were
stable postcatheterization. There was no remarkable hematoma in the
right groin. CK postcatheterization was 64. On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of December</PHI>
the patient's Lopressor was changed to Atenolol and the patient was
started on Coumadin for the stents. The patient at this time on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">15th of December</PHI> had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with a
blood pressure of 120/75% , O2 sats were 99%. As the patient was
being coumadinized on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">16th of December</PHI> , she had a
supertherapeutic response coumadinization with an INR of 5.7. The
plan was to recheck the INR to secure a downward trend as well as
to start planning for discharge. On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">17th of December</PHI> , the INR
was 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximum
INR , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.
DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 17</PHI> with
followup with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hendrix.</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nestor</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vail Cathleen Holman.</PHI>

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VUTTI</PHI> is a 73-year-old gentleman who is a restrained driver
in a single car motor vehicle collision , in which the car went
off the road at a moderate rate of speed ( approximately 45 miles
an hour ) , and struck a telephone pole. There are no skin marks
noted at the scene. There was airbag deployment , and the patient
was wearing a seatbelt. The patient reports feeling "fine" prior
to the motor vehicle collision. However , he has no recollection
of the motor vehicle collision itself , and the next thing he
remembers is waking up and finding the airbag is deployed , and
being in severe pain. He does remember EMS arriving.
Upon arrival of the EMS , he was found to have a heart rate of 30
in a third-degree AV block. The patient denies any chest pain ,
shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting before the motor vehicle
collision. He also denies any fevers , chills , night sweats ,
shortness of breath , headaches or visual changes either before or
after. He had no recent changes in any doses of his medications.
He was also complaining of knee pain.
ED COURSE: In the Emergency Department , he was seen by the
Trauma Team. A full dictation of the Emergency Department
courses has been completed. Please see the computer for further
details of this dictation. However , in brief , he had numerous
CAT scans performed while in the Emergency Department. These
included a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis , head , and chest.
There was also a CT of the cervicothoracic and lumbar spine , with
reconstructions performed. As well as plain x-rays films of the
lower extremity as well a pelvis , C-spine , and chest. Of
significance , the plain films of the knee were negative. The CAT
scan of the chest demonstrated a right frontal periventricular
hypodensity , which was thought to represent a subacute infarct.
He was subsequently admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down Floor. He
was seen by the Neurology Service ( Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lang</PHI> , who is the
Neurology resident ) , who initially saw him.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for myocardial infarction , eight years ago. He
received cardiac stents at that time.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Diabetes.
5. Renal cyst.
6. Cataract.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for coronary stenting; two were placed eight
years ago during his MI , and he had an additional two stents
placed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 2004.
2. Cataract removal.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Glyburide 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
4. Zocor 80 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.
6. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day.
7. Isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:
Blood pressure of 123/51 , heart rate of 48 , respiratory rate of
16. General appearance: He is a well-developed , well-nourished ,
and well-hydrated male , in mildly acute distress. HEENT:
Normocephalic and atraumatic. Extraocular motions are intact.
Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation
at 4 mm. The conjunctivae are pink and the sclera is anicteric.
The oropharynx is significant for a slight bite mark on the
tongue , without any active bleeding. There are moist mucosal
membranes. The neck is supple , and there is no midline
tenderness. There is no JVD. The chest is clear to
auscultation. There is tenderness over the right ribs , as well
as mild sternal tenderness. The heart is regular rhythm ,
although markedly bradycardiac. The abdomen is soft , nontender ,
and nondistended. There are good bowel sounds in all four
quadrants. There is no CVA tenderness. The pelvis is stable to
rock. Extremities: There is tenderness in the abrasions over
the left knee. The left knee is in an immobilizer , at the time
of admission to the floor. He has full range of motion in
ankles , shoulders , and elbows bilaterally. There is decreased
range of motion in the left knee. There is no bony tenderness
along any of the long bones of the upper or lower extremities ,
with exception of the knee. Peripheral vascular , dorsalis pedis ,
posterior , tibial , and radial pulses are all equal bilaterally.
Neuro exam: He is awake , alert , and oriented x3. Cranial nerves
II-XII are intact. Motor is 5/5 in the upper and lower
extremities bilaterally. Sensation is equal bilaterally , in the
upper extremities , lower extremities , and face. There is no
dysmetria or dysarthria. Finger-to-nose is fast and accurate
bilaterally. There is no drift. Skin is warm , dry , and
well-perfused.
LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:
CT C-spine negative. CT head shows a right frontal subacute
infarct. CT chest shows anterior fifth rib fractures
bilaterally. There was also some supraclavicular stranding along
the left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. CT of the
abdomen and pelvis is negative , except for a ruptured renal cyst.
He was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , without
any diverticulitis. The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spines
also demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentally
noted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. CT of the
chest demonstrated the rib fractures , but was otherwise negative.
Laboratory , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate
25 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 185 , and anion gap is 10 , AST
and ALT are 20 and 25 respectively. Alkaline phosphatase is 80.
Lipase is 51. Calcium is 8.8 , the albumin is 4.6 , the CK is 89 ,
CKMB is 3.6 , and troponin was less than assay. His serum
toxicology screen was negative for aspirin , Tylenol ,
benzodiazepine , barbiturates , and tricyclics. Urine drug screen
is also negative. PT , PTT , and INR were 13 , 25.8 , and 0.9
respectively. CBC was significant for white count of 12.0 ,
hemoglobin and hematocrit were 14.6 and 42.2 , and platelets are
250. Urinalysis was negative.
Review of the prehospital EKG demonstrated a complete
( third-degree ) heart block. However , EKG done immediately upon
admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Quintanar Veta</PHI> demonstrated a bifascicular block ,
with a rate in the 40s.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: He was admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down
Unit. He had Zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest , and
atropine remained at his bedside. He also had an additional Zoll
pacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside ,
however , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomatic
with his bifascicular block. He had serial enzymes , which were
performed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. He went
to the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary artery
disease. Please see the dictated cardiology reports for the
findings of the Cath Lab. It was felt , however , this was
unchanged from prior studies. He also went to the
Electrophysiology Lab. They were unable to induce any
ventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during the
prolonged EP studies. He had a pacemaker inserted. The
pacemaker was followed by the Electrophysiology Service , and was
found to be working adequately. The attending was Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vincenza Liliana</PHI> , with the Electrophysiology Service. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Salas Usha--Nannette.</PHI> with the
Cardiology Service saw him and was attending on record.
2. Neurology: He was seen by the Neurology Service. So , this
was under Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Oquendo Adrian</PHI> , the attending neurologisT on the
case. He had an MRI/MRA performed of his head and neck. The
diffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of any
abnormality. There was a region of increase signal intensity on
the T2 and FLAIR images , involving the vasoganglion , extending
the corona radiata. Therefore , given the fact that signal was
seen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was
felt that this was at least 10 days old. Therefore , this was not
felt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle
collision. It was most likely represented an old CVA , which was
not previously detected. Given the fact that the patient
remained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and
radiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10
days old , and this was not further addressed. An MRA of his head
and neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system. The
MRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left
bifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis.
The right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis ,
however , could not be completed excluded. Given artifact , this
could be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex of
the carotid arteries.
3. Musculoskeletal: He was seen by the Orthopedic Service in
the Emergency Department at the time of the trauma , he ultimately
had an MRI that was performed of his knee. This showed tears of
the medial and lateral menisci. There was no evidence of
fracture. He remained in a knee immobilizer. He saw Physical
Therapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated.
With the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acute
intervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with Sports
Medicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. In addition ,
he was noted to have several rib fractures. The rib fractures
were felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complain
of some inspiratory pain throughout his chest. However , he
adamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon
inspiring. It was therefore felt that given the negative enzymes
and the negative Cath , and the known rib fractures that the chest
pain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain. This pain
was well controlled with the combination of Dilaudid and
oxycodone. He was encouraged to take several deep breaths per
hour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia.
4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acute
infection. Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the
last two days of admission. It was felt that this probably
represented stress , given all the recent procedures that were
done , including the catheterization and the electrophysiology
studies , rather than A2 infection. The chest x-ray was performed
on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">29th</PHI> , which demonstrated no infiltrate. This was reviewed
with an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes.
Otherwise , it was essentially negative. In addition , a repeat
urinalysis was performed. The results are pending at the time of
dictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient's
discharge from the hospital. The patient appears well , and
states that he is feeling at his best since the accident.
However , further workup for his white count is not performed at
the present time , however , the patient is informed , as the Rehab
Hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patient
seem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be
reevaluated by a physician.
5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without any
difficulty. He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: He was continued on his Zocor
throughout the hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: He was initially treated with Lovenox 40 mg
sub-Q. q. day for a prophylaxis against DVTs. He is also on
aspirin and Plavix for secondary cardiac and neurological
prophylaxis. The Lovenox is discontinued , at the request of the

8. Endocrine: Given the numerous contrast studies , initially
his metformin was held. However , he was later restarted on this.
In addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered with
sliding scale insulin. His blood sugar was never any significant
problem during his hospitalization.
9. Disposition: The patient will be going to Rehab Facility , in
stable condition. At the Rehab , he will continue to get physical
therapy , which he has received in the hospital. It was felt that
a short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him to
go back living independently again. He will be discharged to the
Rehab in stable condition.

week. Appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Elmer Isom</PHI> is in 3 weeks.
ADDENDUM:
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VUTTI</PHI> had this pacemaker placed and was recovering
uneventfully. However , it was noted that he started having
increasing white count. It was felt this was perhaps due to a
mild urine infection and was started on Levaquin. However , he
started the next day complaining increasing pain in his knee. At
this time , his white count had risen to 23 , 000. The knee was
obviously a concern for possible infection. His knee was warm ,
was tender and was erythematous , compared to the contralateral
side. As a result , the Orthopedic Service was again consulted.
An arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a dry
tap; no fluid was able to be obtained. The subsequent day , he
was complaining of increasing pain , and the sed rate returned in
the 99 with a CRP of 190. The EP Service again evaluated the
patient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clear
infection from the pacer site. He continued to have no erythema
or tenderness around the pacer site. His chest x-ray was
essentially unremarkable. The next day ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/4/20</PHI> ) , he was seen
by the Rheumatology Service , under Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">PGWNSG</PHI> who also felt this
was most likely to be prepatellar bursitis , probably septic in
nature , with a hematoma. He was asked to seen by the Infectious
Disease Service , under Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yamauchi</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Grady Elva.</PHI>
He was started on Ancef 1 gm q.8h. A PICC line will be placed
later today on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/06/20</PHI> and he will be discharged to rehab.
Of note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on the
Ancef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into the
approximately 10000 range. He will continue to get IV Ancef
q.8h. for an additional 12 days. New consultants on the case ,
again Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yamauchi</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Grady Elva.</PHI> with Infectious
Disease , Dr <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">AMUNTD</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gonzalez Cobb</PHI> with Orthopedics and Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">PGWNSG</PHI> with Rheumatology.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">PGSDHC</PHI> is a 78-year-old
gentleman with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and
myocardial infarction in 1998 with known ejection fraction of
20%. PET scan in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 2006 revealed decreasing ejection
fraction and severe left anterior descending territory perfusion
defect. The patient was planned to be electively cathed , but has
deferred until now because of seasonal allergies. The patient
admits to baseline dyspnea on exertion. Cardiac catheterization

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/25/2916</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VWGLSG</PHI> is a 51 year old gentleman
with history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus and unstable angina. The patient was doing yard
work in the afternoon when he experienced an episode of nausea and
vomiting along with chest discomfort. The patient presented to his
primary care physician who noted EKG changes with ST depressions in
V3 to V6 and was sent to the emergency room which was noted to have
an old T wave inversion in lead 3 which was now upright and ST
depressions that were normalizing. CKs at that time were 974 , MB
24.3 , Troponin level was 1.77. The patient received aspirin 5 mg
of intravenous Lopressor , Heparin drip and Adenosine MIBI which was
performed back in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of 1999 revealed inferior ischemia. The
patient underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 16</PHI> , 2001 which
revealed the following: Right dominant system , no significant left
main lesions identified , left anterior descending coronary artery
with a discreet mid 65% lesion , distal 99% lesion and first
diagonal coronary artery with a proximal discrete 70% lesion , left
circumflex coronary artery with a distal after the second obtuse
marginal discrete 60% lesion , supplying the second obtuse marginal.
First marginal coronary artery had an ostial discrete 90% lesion
and a second obtuse marginal had an ostial discrete 100% lesion.
Right coronary artery had a mid discrete 95% lesion supplying the
right posterior descending coronary artery. He was also noted to
have collateral flow from left anterior descending artery to the
right posterior descending artery. The patient underwent
echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 16</PHI> , 2001 which revealed the following: 1.
There was mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced
with an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. There is severe
hypokinesis of the basal and mid segments of the inferior wall and
inferior septum. In addition , there is severe hypokinesis of the
posterior wall , apex and distal anterior wall. THis is suggestive
of multiple coronary artery disease. 2. The right ventricle
appears normal in size and systolic function. 3. The mitral valve
appears mildly thickened. The anterior mitral leaflet is mildly
elongated and there might be mild systolic prolapse of the anterior
leaflet. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. 4. The aortic valve
is trileaflet and appears mildly thickened. There is no aortic
stenosis or regurgitation. 5. The tricuspid valve appears
structurally normal. No significant tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. 6. There is no pericardial effusion.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/05/2916</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old female
with a history of lupus , hypertension ,
asthma , breast cancer status post mastectomy and chemotherapy ,
rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation who was found
pauses of up to 6.6 seconds on a Holter monitor and was admitted
for consideration of pacer placement. The patient states that over
the last several months since <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> , 2001 , she has noted
increasing dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance.
She also has noticed episodes of palpitation. She presented to her
primary care physician in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 2001 with these complaints. He
put a Holter monitor on her <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/26/16</PHI> which showed her to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates between 67 and 214 with a
mean rate of 117 beats per minute. Her primary care physician , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Olene Pasquale</PHI> , initially put the patient on digoxin and Coumadin. Her
rate remained elevated , however , so he changed the Coumadin to
Cardizem. About one month ago he also added propafenone 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/25</PHI> she presented to her cardiologist , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nella , Ingeborg Vannessa</PHI> , complaining of continued palpitations and ankle edema.
He stopped her Cardizem at that time as he felt that was what was
contributing to her lower extremity edema and placed her on
atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d. instead. She had a leepy Holter monitor
placed from <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/26-20/.</PHI> Wednesday morning , her second day of
atenolol , she noted having episodes where "I felt my heart pause
and then surge when it started to beat again". This was associated
with lightheadedness x several seconds. She did not have any
associated chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting ,
diaphoresis or syncope. She called Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nella , Ingeborg Vannessa</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/27</PHI> and he
told her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone. Over
the last two days she has had flutter episodes of irregular heart
beat but has had no lightheadedness since stopping the atenolol on
Wednesday. She has noted increased shortness of breath over the
last couple of days , as well , on climbing one flight of stairs.
She also has orthopnea using two pillows at night , does not have
PND , does have lower extremity edema. On the day of admission
which was <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/29/16</PHI> Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hendrix.</PHI> received a transmitted Holter recording
from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Uyeda</PHI> that showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with
episodes of atrial fibrillation with high rates but also that she
had episodes of 6.6 second pauses. Thus , she called the patient
and had her sent via ambulance to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI>
emergency department for consideration of admission for pacemaker
placement. In the emergency department the patient's vitals were
she was afebrile with a pulse of 112 , blood pressure 150/81 ,
breathing 18 , satting 95% on room air. Her review of systems was
negative for fever , chills , or sweats , chest pain , syncope ,
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria or rash. In
the emergency department she revealed 40 of IV Lasix and was sent
to the floor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a 52-year-old female
resting comfortably at 45 degrees , in no
acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light
and accommodation. Oropharynx revealed moist mucous membranes , no
erythema. Neck veins appeared to be around 10 cm. CHEST:
Wheezing bilaterally and crackles at both bases. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1S2 , did have an S4 and did have a
3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex to the axilla. She
also had a 1/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left upper
sternal border. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with good
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused. She did have 2+
lower extremity edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 146 , potassium 3.6 ,
chloride 117 , bicarb 19 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 ,
glucose 120 , CK 76 , troponin 0 , CBC showed a white count of 8.73 ,
hematocrit 29.1 which was around her baseline. Her baseline had
been 30-38 on the last admission. Her platelets were 289. ESR was
75 which is what it had been in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> . INR was 3.1
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
redistribution. Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at
94 with a normal axis , normal intervals. She did have left atrial
enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement. Her last echo
done at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CKIW</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/19/16</PHI> showed an ejection fraction of 63% ,
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , LV systolic function
preserved , a thickened mitral valve , moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation plus left atrial enlargement , aortic valve thickened ,
mild AI , no AS. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation , moderately
increased pulmonary artery pressures , normal RV plus her atrial
enlargement and they made notes that the mitral regurgitation was
increased on this echo when compared with an echo done one year
prior at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CKIW</PHI> .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Breast cancer status post left
mastectomy with lymph node dissection
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/14.</PHI> Pathology revealed invasive
ductal carcinoma , grade 3/3 , node
negative. She is status post four
cycles of Adriamycin and cytoxan.
2. History of lupus x 21 years.
3. History of rheumatic heart disease.
4. History of hypertension.
5. History of asthma diagnosed three years
ago.
6. History of recent atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lisinopril 40 q.d.; prednisone 10 q.d.;
Coumadin 5 q.d.; Prevacid 30 q.d.;
chloroquine 100 q.d.; Plaquenil 200 b.i.d.; Lasix 20 q.d.;
albuterol inhaler p.r.n.; Flovent 220 2-3 puffs b.i.d.; Flonase
b.i.d.; propafenone 150 t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Tetracycline which give her nausea and vomiting
and sometimes she got that with aspirin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nurse currently on a medical leave of
absence. She lives alone. Tobacco history she
does smoke 1 pack per day since she was 23. No ethanol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Brother with sarcoid plus a history of
hypertension. Father with prostate cancer.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: From an ischemia standpoint
she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. We
did continue her antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril 40 q.d.
From a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral
regurgitation was the main cause of her 2-3 month history of
increasing dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , and
increasing orthopnea. Thus , we got a repeat echo which showed
borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with an estimated ejection
fraction of 55% , normal RV. The mitral valve was moderately
thickened and rheumatic in appearance. The mitral valve area was
estimated at 1.3 cm squared although this may have an under
estimate. There is severe mitral regurgitation and moderate left
atrial enlargement. The aortic valve was calcified. There was
mild aortic insufficiency. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation
with a regurgitant velocity of 3.5 consistent with mild elevation
in pulmonary systolic pressures of approximately 48 mmHg plus right
atrial pressure. Given her severe and symptomatic mitral
regurgitation we then decided that she would likely benefit from a
mitral valve replacement. Then we proceeded to cardiac
catheterization. Her left heart catheterization showed a left
dominant system with clean coronary arteries. Her right heart
catheterization revealed elevated right ventricular and pulmonary
artery pressures and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
31. She was diuresed several kg from her admission weight with IV
Lasix and she was continued on her ace inhibitor for afterload
reduction. Consultation with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTTESG</PHI> of cardiothoracic surgery
was obtained and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatly
from an MVR. Thus , plan was made for patient to be discharged home
and then to be readmitted electively when Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTTESG</PHI> returned from
vacation for an MVR. From a rate and rhythm standpoint , the
patient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospital
stay. We continued her propafenone and Coumadin for her history of
atrial fibrillation and she did have excellent rate control on
this. She had no further pauses on telemetry during hospital stay
and thus it was felt that given she was asymptomatic and did not
have any pauses off of beta blockade , that she did not need
pacemaker placement on this admission.
2 ) Pulmonary: From a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely she
had cardiac asthma as with diuresis her wheezing and shortness of
breath was nearly 100% improved.
3 ) Rheumatology: From a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus was in
good control. She did not have of her typical lupus flare symptoms
such as arthralgias or rash , fever and , thus , we continued her on
her Plaquenil , her chloroquine and her prednisone.
4 ) Renal: She did not appear to have any renal involvement of her
lupus and her renal function was within normal limits throughout
her stay.
5 ) Heme: She had a normal cytic anemia at 29 which was within her
baseline range of 29-38. Full iron studies were sent and it was
felt that it was most likely consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.
6 ) Prophylaxis: From a prophylaxis standpoint she was on Coumadin
for atrial fibrillation so was not considered for heparin and she
was continued on Prilosec throughout her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.; lisinopril 40
mg p.o.q.d.; magnesium gluconate 2 grams

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/26/2917</PHI>
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">GZWD</PHI> is a 73-year-old gentleman who returned to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> to the emergency room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3/17</PHI> with crescendo
spontaneous angina and shortness of breath. He is three and one
half months after a presentation with subacute left circumflex
thrombosis , ischemic mitral regurgitation , pulmonary edema and a
small nontransmural myocardial infarction. His angiography at that
time revealed diffuse coronary atherosclerosis with attenuation and
diffuse narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery
and a small codominant right coronary system with extensive diffuse
disease. Large circumflex system with focally severe and
additional diffuse but noncritical stenosis with superimposed
thrombus. Dilatation of the left circumflex resulted in extensive
dissection but with eventual achievement of a very good
angiographic and clinical result after placement of multiple stents
and that his course was that of gradual recovery and uneventful
return home.
He remained frail and limited prior to this admission and
approximately six weeks prior to admission , began to have
occasional pain and shortness of breath. He went to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory for intervention. He underwent a
rotablator procedure on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3/17</PHI> in the cath. laboratory which
resulted in perforation of circumflex coronary artery into the
pericardial space with extravasation of blood. He went into
cardiogenic shock which was alleviated by intra-aortic balloon pump
placement and was seen in consultation by the cardiac surgery
service for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. He went to
the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3/17</PHI> where he underwent emergent coronary
artery revascularization. He sustained a retained rotablator burr
in the left circumflex system and a left circumflex perforation.
He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery , saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal #2 , #3 and #1 and removal of a
rotablator burr , repair of the left ventricular apex vent. site.
He came off bypass on 2 mcg of epinephrine and his intra-aortic
balloon pump. During his code in the cath. lab , the patient had
become hypotensive requiring intubation and intra-aortic balloon
pump placement as noted above. A Foley catheter was placed by the
urology service attending with much difficulty. His chest was left
open at the time of operation as the patient was coagulopathic and
Esmarch closure was placed.
His postoperative course: His coagulopathy was reversed with blood
products and his chest was closed without event on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 5</PHI> , 02. He
was also seen in consultation by the diabetic management service to
help with his diabetic management. He continued to have
postoperative cardiac failure , remained on Dopamine , intra-aortic
balloon pump , was slowly weaned and diuresis ensued. His
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on postoperative day three
uneventfully. He continued to make good improvement and was
extubated on postoperative day four and transferred to the
step-down unit. He had mild confusion but has had a history of
cerebrovascular accident in the past. He still requires diuresis.
Chest tubes remained in place for very high chest tube output. He
was seen in consultation by the vascular surgery service for his
severe peripheral vascular disease and painful right foot. He was
also continued to be followed by urologic service and his Foley was
left in place. He did have a bump in his BUN and creatinine and
renal consult was obtained and helps with management of his fluid
balance. He was also seen in consultation by the thoracic surgery
service for increased chest tube output , mainly from the right
pleural chest tube. His other chest tubes were discontinued
without any complications and his acute renal failure began to
resolve. He received Albumin and packed cells to correct
hypoalbuminemia and also his postoperative anemia along with Lasix
for diuresis. He continued to make slow improvement and advanced
nutritionally. He had a vascular MRI which was done as requested
by vascular surgery service in preparation for potential
revascularization to his right leg. He continued to improve. His
BUN and creatinine were 90/3.5 at their highest level and have been
slowly declining over the past several weeks to today's level of 47
for BUN and 1.3 for creatinine. He continues to have low blood
cell counts; his white blood cell count is 3 today and his
hematocrit is 32.8. Platelet count is 98. He will require
follow-up for these on a two times weekly basis. His MRI shows
mild irregularity of the distal abdominal aorta as well as the left
common iliac artery , mild narrowing over long segment about three
cm. over the right external iliac artery. There is moderate focal
narrowing in the right common femoral artery at the bifurcation
between the superficial femoral and deep femoral and there is
complete occlusion in the distal right superficial femoral artery
with reconstitution three cm further. Multiple areas of focal
narrowing are seen in the proximal and distal left superficial
femoral artery , high grade stenosis in the proximal left popliteal
artery. The posterior tibial artery on the right side is
completely occluded proximally. On the left side , there is high
grade stenosis in the anterior tibial proximally as well as
occlusion of the anterior tibial in the mid calf with
reconstitution distally and complete occlusion of the posterior
tibial artery at it's origin. Peroneal shows moderate posterior
stenosis. He has moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease in the
lower extremities with multiple areas of narrowing inclusion. He
is to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ilse Hector.</PHI> , Division of Vascular
Surgery for revascularization of his lower extremities.
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">GZWD</PHI> is to be discharged on the following medications:

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies consumption of alcohol and
has no history of tobacco or injection drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient was in no
acute distress. HEENT: Revealed a JVP at 8 to 9 cm of water.
Benign oropharynx. Moist mucous membranes. Pulmonary: Showed
no wheezes , rhonchi , or crackles , and a clear exam to
auscultation in both lung fields. Cardiovascular: Regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. No murmur , rub , or gallop
was appreciated. Abdomen: She had positive bowel sounds. She
was nontender and nondistended , obese , but no suprapubic
tenderness. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: There is no
cyanosis , clubbing , or edema appreciated. She had 1+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent laboratory findings at the time of
admission include hematocrit of 36.3 , white count of 7.7 , and
platelets 317 , 000. Sodium 138 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 96 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 102 , and creatinine 2.8. Glucose was 88.
Otherwise , she was not coagulopathic and normal liver function
tests , and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. Her EKG on
admission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats per
minute and that her EKG was unchanged from her prior EKG from
<PHI TYPE="DATE">July 10</PHI> , 2005.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur and
labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor
renal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IV
hydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.
Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such ,
the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 30</PHI> ,
2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. In
addition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output was
monitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her second
hospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose of
beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as
well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient's
creatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patient
was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her
hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the
130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of
hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid
with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. As
the patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHF
exacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be more
aggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , the
patient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continued
to gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient was
changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to discharge
and was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of net
diureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She was
discharged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effect
and maintaining adequate blood pressure.
2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin
doses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , the
evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 29</PHI> , 2005 , and the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 30</PHI> ,
2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.
Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but
was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. There
were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,
which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained on
aspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin for
the remainder of her admission. She had no further chest pain
events.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced and
maintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200
mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this with
good effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.
daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT
at 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from her
rhythm or rate standpoint.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine returned to baseline by
hospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renal
failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to
admission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no further
issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive
hydration , taking good p.o. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 28</PHI> , 2005 , the patient
developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated
nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported
was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,
identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the
past year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given the
dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be
related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone
protocol was obtained on <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 28</PHI> , 2005 , which showed no
evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again
gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient responded
well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of
her symptoms by <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 29</PHI> , 2005 , hospital day #3.
5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by
<PHI TYPE="DATE">September 29</PHI> , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeine
p.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. The
patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use
narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital
course.
6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her home
dose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and
regular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low ,
ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.
This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospital
setting. As such , the diabetes service after consultation
recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.
and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requested
minimal injections during her hospital course and at home. As
such , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as the
patient continued to express preference for twice daily
injections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over her
hospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. In
addition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course which
showed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid was
increased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with her
endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restarted
on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss
secondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable over
course of her hospital stay. She was continued on a
low-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 white
blood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especially
given her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was started
on a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. She
remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her
urine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units of
mixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normal
limits over her hospital admission. As such , no further therapy
was required.
9. The patient was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 4</PHI> , 2005 , with
VNA services.
PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE:
1. To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c and
to repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as well
as her Synthroid regimen.
2. To have followup with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Johnny , Nicholson R.</PHI> in the Coumadin Clinic to
maximize her Coumadin therapy and ensure that she is therapeutic.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
2. Coumadin 1.5 mg p.o. daily.
3. Aspirin 81 p.o. daily.
4. Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.o.d.
5. Insulin NPH 35 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m.
6. Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. daily.
7. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4-mg tablet 1 tablet every 5
minutes x3 days for p.r.n. chest pain.
8. Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily.
9. Imdur 90 mg p.o. daily.

in leads III , V5 and V6. Chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/07/21</PHI> was consistent
with congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
There is mild CHF , bilateral atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on the day prior to
her scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/08/21</PHI> , she was brought to the operating room where Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Norris.</PHI> performed a CABG x3 using the LIMA to bypass the LAD and
saphenous vein graft to bypass the OM1 and saphenous vein graft
to bypass the PDA. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107
minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. The vein
was harvested from both legs. The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit after her surgery where she remained
intubated for two days due to poor lung
compliance. She was also hypotensive in the postoperative period
and treated with vasoactive medications. By postoperative day
#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,
however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and her
Lopressor was increased. By post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillation
was rate controlled and she was started on Coumadin. By
postoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the ICU to
the Step-Down Unit. At that point , she was neurologically intact
and her pain was well controlled. She was being treated with
beta-blockers and Coumadin for AFib. From a respiratory
perspective , the patient was being treated with aggressive
pulmonary toilet and chest PT. Her chest x-ray showed a small
right pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well with
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's diet was
advanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.
The patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative fluid
retention. She also was seen by the Diabetes Management Service
throughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.
On the step-down Unit on postoperative day #5 , the patient
experienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 and
she became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after her
diltiazem was increased. She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit where she was observed for three more days.
During that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized although
she remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. On
postoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to the
Step-Down Unit where she spent the remaining six days of her
hospital stay. The patient's chest x-ray suggested that she was
volume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated with
Lasix and Zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowly
from 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. The diuretics were decreased. A chest
ultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesis
revealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis and
minimal effusion. The focus then became on chest PT , pulmonary
toilet and deep breathing and coughing. The patient continued to
ambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , the
patient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis in
the right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.
From a cardiac perspective in the Step-Down Unit , the patient
was in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11
and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for the
final three days of her hospital stay. The patient had been
started on Coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation and
this medication should continue at least until she follow up with
a cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heart
rhythm. By postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinus
rhythm with a stable blood pressure. She was oxygenating well on
room air and was ambulating effectively on her own. She had no
complaints and was ready for discharge to home. On that day , her
temperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,
blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 saturation 94% on
room air. The patient was seven kilograms below her preoperative
weight.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with VNA Services.
DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat 2100
calorie per day , 4 gm sodium per day diet.

breakfast and coffee while walking to living room , well-circumscribed ,
4/10 intensity , constant , w/o radiation to jaw/arm/back , worse on deep
inspiration , w/ associated nausea and dizziness. Pt sat down w/ pain
2/10 , administered nitro spray x2 w/o relief , wife measured BP 158/90s
( usu 140/85 ). No other sx , but pt describes pain as similar but less
intense than that experienced in 2002 MI. Denies h/o CP since then
despite recently active baseline ( yesterday washing windows/ climbing
ladders , over last months doing cement work in church ) , but notes DOE

nifedipine sprays immediately prior to exertion/activity.On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/29/21</PHI> , pt
was evaluated for CABG by surgeon Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Naomi Williams</PHI> , who noted possible
candidacy for combined CABG/TMLR since diagonal likely too small to

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 63 year old female with hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease , who presents
two days status post a syncopal episode in the setting of chest
pain. Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , postmenopausal , and she has no
family history of coronary artery disease , and denies the use of
tobacco. Her cardiac history is as follows: She has a history of
chronic stable angina. She underwent a cardiac catheterization in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1992 notable for 75% OM2 lesion , 50% ostial right RCA
lesion , and ejection fraction at the time was 75%. She had an ETT
performed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1994 which she exercised for 3 minutes 42
seconds with a peak heart rate of 127 , systolic blood pressure of
156 , rate pressure product of 20k. She was stopped secondary to
chest pain , she had some T wave inversions in the inferolateral
leads felt to be consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia.
She also had an echocardiogram performed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> of 1994 with
an ejection fraction of 60-65% , no regional wall motion
abnormalities. She has been followed in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> Clinic by Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Eileen O. Hernandez</PHI> , maintained on the regimen of Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , enteric coated
aspirin , and Procardia XL 60 mg q.day. She reports her angina has
been stable for years. She takes 1-2 sublingual nitroglycerin per
week. Her pain is typically precipitated by brisk walking or other
forms of exercises. She reports that her daily workout consists of
some situps three times a day , and also usually a walk. She states
that two days prior to admission while walking her normal speed
towards the bus station , she developed some right chest wall
tightness and shortness of breath consistent with her typical
angina. She was in the middle of the street , decided to walk
across the street with the plan to take a sublingual nitroglycerin ,
however she felt light headed on continued ambulation and had a
syncopal episode. She reports that on awakening she had no
confusion. She did report the loss of urine incontinence but has
urinary incontinence at baseline. She denies any stool
incontinence , no seizure activity per observers. No complications
prior to the episode. She denies any orthopnea or PND at baseline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable for coronary artery disease , as
above. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes
mellitus , she is on insulin. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5.
Hypothyroidism. 6. History of guaiac positive stools. 7.
History of a frozen shoulder. 8. Vitamin B 12 deficiency. 9.
Gallstone disease. 10. Urinary incontinence. 11. History of a
cystocele.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , NPH insulin 66 units
q.AM and 15 units q.PM , Procardia XL 60 mg
q.day , metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. , vitamin B 12 1 mg IM q.month ,
Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , Synthroid .125 mg q.day , aspirin 325 mg
q.day , p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease. Positive
for diabetes mellitus in her mother and her
daughter. Also positive for lung cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</PHI> alone , no pets. She has
ten children , 32 grandchildren , and 4 great
grandchildren. She denies any use of tobacco or denies any use of
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9 ,
heart rate of 78 , blood pressure 160/90 ,
respiratory rate of 20 , with a room air saturation of 93%. In
general , obese black female in no apparent distress. HEENT
examination was PERRL , EOMI , neck supple , full range of motion , she
had a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and
2+ pulses bilaterally. Lungs were clear. Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a soft grade
1/6 systolic ejection murmur , best heard at the left lower sternal
border. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender ,
nondistended. She was guaiac negative. Extremities showed no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 2+
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Neurologic examination
was grossly nonfocal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG on admission showed a heart rate of 73 ,
intervals of .164 , .076 , .049 seconds for PR ,
QRS , and QTC. Axis was 71. No Q waves and no acute ST or T wave
changes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 ,
bicarb 25 , BUN and creatinine of 16 and
1.3 , glucose of 282. LFTs were within normal limits. CK of 213 ,
cholesterol 179. Other labs showed a TSH of 1.5 , ferritin 181 ,
TIBC of 226 , troponin I was 0.0 , hematocrit was 39.4 , white count
7.15 , platelet count of 348 , 000. Coagulation studies were within
normal limits. Urinalysis showed 2-4 WBCs , 3+ bacteria. Her urine
culture revealed 50 , 000 suspected enteric gram negative rods. This
is a urine culture from <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14/11.</PHI> A chest x-ray revealed no
infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIAC: Cardiac wise , she ruled out for an MI by enzymes and
EKG. She underwent a standard Bruce protocol ETT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/11/11.</PHI> She
exercised for 8 minutes , stopped secondary to fatigue. Maximum
heart rate was 95 , maximum blood pressure 170/75. She developed
typical angina in her recovery which spontaneously resolved. She
had 1 mm down sloping ST segment depressions in II , III , F , V4
through V6 , which resolved into recovery. These changes were
suggestive of ischemia , but less specific because of her baseline
LVH. She subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/12/11</PHI> , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid RCA , 90% stenosis at
the origin of the PDA , 30% mid LAD , and 50% OM2. She subsequently
underwent angioplasty of the RCA and the PDA lesion on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14/11</PHI> with
some mild haze at the PDA. Therefore , recommendations were for
heparinization for a 24 hour period. She remained pain free
throughout this hospitalization. The EPS Service saw her regarding
the issue of syncope. Further workup was performed including
carotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis in
either of the carotid arteries. She underwent a cardiac
echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/13/11</PHI> to rule out evidence of regional wall
motion abnormality that might suggest the possibility of a prior MI
as a source of potential ectopy. She was noted to have 2+ mitral
regurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and had
no reported regional wall motion abnormality. She also had no
arrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. The
EPS Service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the RCA
probably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes with
possible bradycardia during ischemic episodes. They favored
holding off on the EPS study. They felt that the revascularization
and follow-up stress testing were the recommended workup for this
patient and recommendations are for follow-up ETT in four to six
weeks. Her medical regimen was adjusted in the form of increasing
her Lopressor from 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as her
rate and blood pressure tolerated this regimen. She remained pain
free throughout the hospitalization. She will have follow-up with
her primary M.D.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS: Her glucose remained under fairly good
control during this hospitalization with her regimen of NPH.
Hemoglobin A1C was checked and is pending at the time of discharge.
3. URINARY: She was noted to have 3+ bacteria on her urinalysis
and 50 , 000 colony forming units on a urine culture of <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14/11.</PHI> We
will empirically treat her for a UTI with Bactrim 1 DS b.i.d. times
three days.
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Eileen O. Hernandez</PHI> She is to have an
appointment in one to two weeks. She is also to have a
follow-up ETT in four to six weeks. She should also have a repeat
urine culture in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> Clinic during her follow-up.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
t.i.d. , Synthroid .125 micrograms q.day , metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. ,
Procardia XL 60 mg q.day , nitroglycerin .4 mg p.r.n. , NPH insulin
66 units q.AM and 15 units subcu q.PM , and Bactrim 1 DS p.o. b.i.d.
times three days.
DISPOSITION: Discharge to home.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. Her diet should be low fat , low
cholesterol ADA diet. Activity as
tolerated.
COMPLICATIONS DURING HOSPITALIZATION: None.

at HD on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/4</PHI> , which was similar in presentation to <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/27</PHI> episode from
recent admission.
1 ) CV: Whether or not pt actually ever a V-fib arrest seems to be in some
doubt , as she has never had an arrhythmia on tele. However , given this
is the second presentation , a proper arrhythmia evaluation was
warranted. The pt's differential included arrythmia vs obesity
hypoventilation ( pt reports OSA sx ) , hypoglycemia , and HD-related
hypotension. Ischemia ) serial cardiac enzymes negative. Pt was
continued on asa , bb , and placed on statin and NTG prn while ruling out
ischemic heart disease in anticipation of possible EP study. PET
perfusion scan for reversible ischemia was negative , showing normal
perfusion. Pump: JVP not appreciated , decreased LE edema relative to
prior admission. pt was continued home dose diuretic , and kept on a BB ,
CCB , and her ACEi to goal SBP&lt;120. Rhythm: Pt was placed on telemetry to
monitor for arrythmia while on floor. No events were noted , but given
history , pt was taken to cath lab for EP study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/8/21.</PHI> EPS showed
normal conduction , normal SA node , and so a loop recorder device was
implanted , which will monitor pt's HR and record if HR&gt; or &lt; parameters ,
or if pt triggers device to record. No signs/sx of bleeding , infectino ,
hematoma. Pt discharged on 3 day course of Keflex , to be given after HD.
RENAL: ESRD on HD. Pt HD on Wed and Sat am of admission , which she
tolerated with no difficulty. Pt was continued on EPO 10 , 000U qHD. Pt
has tunneled line in Right IJ for access.
HEME: Anemia: in setting of ESRD , baseline Hct around 30. Pt on
epogen. Anemia studies WNL.
ENDO: Diabetes type 2: Long and short-acting SC insulin. BID NPH
started at lower than home dose while oral diet is held , with lower
sliding scales , due to significant parts os stay where pt was NPO for
procedures. Wil lbe discharged on home insulin regimen.
ID: pt reports 4 day h/o productive cough prior to admission. Pt
afebrile , but on HD6 , pt has eleavtion in WBC ( 6.9--&gt;12 ) , however
pt afebrile , asymptomatic , CXR shows no infiltrative process , and in
setting of recent procedure. Pt was placed on levofloxacin renally dosed.
DERM: Brawny skin changes: Lac Hydrin started. Candidiasis noted in folds
between pt's pannus and groin. 2% Miconazole topical poder started
PPX: PT received heparin SC , and Nexium , wil be discharged on protonix.

FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of heart disease.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On presentation , T 97.3 , BP 143/70 , pulse 57 , 98%
on 2 liters. This is an obese female in no apparent distress ,
sitting up in bed. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Sclerae
anicteric. Neck: Supple , JVP at 14 cm. Chest: Crackles
bilaterally , left greater than right , half way up both lung
fields with mild decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No
murmur , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and
nondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities with 3+ edema as well as areas of erythematous and
shiny shallow ulcerations. Neurologically , euthymic without
focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , significant for sodium 147 ,
potassium 3.4 , chloride 110 , CO2 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose 69. CBC was significant for white count of 6.7 ,
hematocrit 39.4 , and platelets of 258. Her CK was 432. Her
troponin was less than assay. Her BNP was greater than assay and
D-dimer was 50 and 69.
Chest x-ray showed decreased lung volumes with moderate cardiac
enlargement. EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 ,
axis of -36 and no acute changes.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 63-year-old woman with history of
congestive heart failure who presented with likely congestive
heart failure exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: There was concern regarding acute
and subacute silent ischemia given new ST-T wave changes in
lateral leads on the EKG. The patient was continued on her
aspirin as well as statin. She was ruled out for an MI with
negative troponins x 3. She was continued on a low-dose
short-acting beta-blocker ( Lopressor ). She was also continued on
an ACE inhibitor with this switched to captopril as a
short-acting ACE inhibitor , which was titrated up as tolerated
for a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. An adenosine MIBI
was performed which was negative for perfusion defects. However ,
echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.
Cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workup
with cardiac catheterization. However , the patient refused the
catheterization.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
However , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
admission. She was monitored by cardiac telemetry with several
episodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia. Her electrolytes were carefully monitored and
repleted as necessary. She remained asymptomatic with the runs
of NSVT and was continued on her beta-blocker. Given her history
of atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,
she was restarted on Coumadin.
Pump: The patient presented with a frank fluid overload with
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , and a BNP greater than
assay. She was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than
-2 liters a day. She responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix t.i.d. Her
creatinine was carefully followed and did increase on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/26/18</PHI> ,
at which point diuresis was put on hold. The patient diuresed
about 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until
<PHI TYPE="DATE">11/26/18.</PHI> At this point , she was thought to be very close to
euvolemic.
Given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejection
fraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilated
cardiomyopathy was begun. The patient did not wish for further
investigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac MRI. Her
other labs were unremarkable including a TSH , which was normal ,
an ANA which was negative , iron studies which did not show iron
overload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of this
dictation. The patient will require close followup with careful
fluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestive
heart failure service.
Pulmonary: She initially presented with shortness of breath.
However , this resolved with diuresis. She has a history of PE as
well as DVT and an elevated dimer was found on admission. There
was initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution of
symptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive of
pulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiral
chest CT.
Heme: The patient's hematocrit was followed. The patient has
chronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continued
on folate and iron replacement.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on NPH 20 units for her
known diabetes. Her blood sugars were in excellent control on
this regimen. Avandia was held given it contraindication in
heart failure.
Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is up
from about 0.8 in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> of 2003. Her urine eosinophils and
sediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted which
is consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. Her creatinine
remained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/26/18</PHI> , when her
creatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/29/18</PHI> , when it
reached 2.7. Repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils and
sediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the time
of this dictation. The most likely explanation for increasing
creatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volume
depletion. Diuresis was put on hold on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/28/18</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/29/18.</PHI>
Given her increased creatinine , her ACE inhibitor dose was halfed
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/29/18.</PHI> The plan is to continue to monitor her creatinine
function , follow up on her urine chemistries and if her
creatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.
Infectious Disease: The patient was found to have a UTI with E.
Coli that was sensitive to Bactrim and she was treated with
Bactrim with resolution.
Rheumatological: The patient with known chronic pain as well as
arthritis. Her Celebrex was held given her increased creatinine
and its propensity to cause fluid retention. Her joint exam
revealed swollen PIP joints of both hands as well as marked
swelling over both wrists. A rheumatoid factor was sent and that
came back negative. For her pain , she was given oxycodone p.r.n.
Once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitioned
to Celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may be
more effected for her arthritis. ANA came back negative.
Psyche: She was continued on Celexa for depression.
Code status: Full code.
FOLLOWUP: The patient needs to follow up with the congestive
heart failure service as well as her primary care physician.

ADDENDUM
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hamilton</PHI> is a 56-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for inferior myocardial
infarction in 1995 , which was treated with angioplasty at that
time. Since then , he has been stable on medical management until
approximately two months prior to this admission , when he began
noting anterior chest pain with exertion. He underwent a stress
test , which was found to be abnormal , and was referred for cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was performed on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">10/09/21</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> . This study revealed a
70% proximal stenosis of his left anterior descending coronary
artery , a 90% mid segment stenosis of his first diagonal coronary
artery , a 50% mid segment stenosis of his circumflex coronary
artery , a 90% ostial stenosis of his first obtuse marginal , a
100% proximal stenosis of his right coronary artery as well as a
30% ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery. Collateral
flow was noted from the left anterior descending to the posterior
descending coronary artery. Given the results of this cardiac
catheterization , he was referred for elective revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is
significant for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , lower back
pain , nephrolithiasis as well as a 3.4 cm infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm at the bifurcation of the aorta.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for open cholecystectomy in
the 1990s as well as removal of a cyst from his left wrist in
2005. In addition , the patient underwent lithotripsy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of
2006.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports a family history of coronary
artery disease. His brother has undergone coronary artery bypass
grafting in the past and his mother , father and brother all have
suffered myocardial infarction. He also has a significant family
history of hypertension in both of his parents.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient reports a 20-pack-year cigarette
smoking history as well as a history of social alcohol use ,
approximately five to six beers on the weekend.
ALLERGIES: The patient reports no known drug allergies , however
tetanus immunization in the past has led to arm swelling.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril
40 mg p.o. daily , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mg
p.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o. daily , Vicodin 5 mg p.o. as
needed for low back pain as well as vitamins C , D , A , and E.
The patient was seen in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Erickson-Witt Quesnel Healthcare</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/31/21</PHI>
and underwent physical examination.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination at that time revealed
the patient to be afebrile with resting heart rate of 52 beats
per minute and regular. The patient had a resting blood pressure
of 142/76 in the right arm and 148/76 in the left arm. He had a
room air oxygen saturation of 95%. Examination of the head ,
eyes , ears , nose and throat revealed the pupils to be equal ,
round , reactive to light and accommodation. The dentition was
without evidence of infection and carotid bruits were not
appreciable bilaterally over the carotid arteries. Examination
of the heart revealed it to be in regular rate and rhythm with a
grade 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal
border. Examination of the lungs revealed breath sounds to be
clear bilaterally throughout all lung fields. Examination of the
abdomen revealed a well-healed right upper quadrant incision
consistent with prior open cholecystectomy. Examination of the
extremities revealed them to be without scarring , varicosities or
edema and pulses were 2+ and equal to full extent of all
extremities. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented
x3 with no focal neurological deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values obtained in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Erickson-Witt Quesnel Healthcare</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/31/21</PHI> included a sodium of 139 , potassium of
3.7 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of 82 , magnesium of
1.6 , white blood cell count of 10.9 , hematocrit 49.2 , and
platelet count of 386 , 000. Coagulation studies were within
normal limits with an INR of 1 and the urinalysis was within
normal limits. Cardiac catheterization data from <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/09/21</PHI> are as
stated above in the history of present illness. Echocardiogram
performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/31/21</PHI> revealed a 65% ejection fraction with
trivial mitral valve insufficiency and no noted regional wall
motion abnormalities. EKG obtained on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/09/21</PHI> showed a normal
sinus rhythm at 55 beats per minute with no acute ST or T-wave
changes. Chest x-ray performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/31/2921</PHI> was without
evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4/21</PHI> as a
same-day admission and was taken directly to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 including
the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the ramus and second
obtuse marginal coronary arteries and the left radial artery to
the right coronary artery. Significant times of this operation
included a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 173 minutes with an
aortic cross-clamp time of 156 minutes. For further details of
this operation , please refer to the dictated operative note. The
patient's immediate postoperative period was uncomplicated. He
was extubated on the day of surgery and considered a good
candidate for transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. His temporary cardiac
pacing wires and chest drainage tubes and a Jackson-Pratt drain
were all discontinued on postoperative day #2. On the Step-Down
Unit , he was noted to have a high white blood cell count of
approximately 17 in the immediate perioperative period , however
the white blood cell count had improved markedly to 11.9 by
postoperative day #3. He had a PA and lateral chest x-ray on
postoperative day #3 , which revealed satisfactory postoperative
appearance of the chest. The patient was ambulating and
tolerating a full diet without difficulty and is now considered
in good candidate for discharge to home with visiting nurse
services on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/08/21</PHI> , postoperative day #4.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Medications at the time of discharge
include aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily ,
diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. as needed
for constipation , Zetia 10 mg p.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o.
daily , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily x5 days , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily x5
days , metformin 500 mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily ,
and oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.4 h. as needed for pain.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is instructed to make and
keep all of his follow-up appointments and shower and wash his
wounds with soap and water each day. He is to continue diuresis
with Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily for five days and then discontinue
until his re-evaluation at a follow-up appointment with his PCP
or cardiologist and 1-2 weeks. Of note , this patient was
diagnosed for the first time as a type II diabetic during this
admission with a hemoglobin A1c of 7.2 prior to admission. He
was followed by the Diabetes Management Service postoperatively ,
and was started on metformin 500 mg a day and should follow up
with his primary care physician in 1-2 weeks for follow-up check
of his blood sugar and any necessary adjustment in his diabetic
medications. He is instructed to make follow-up appointments
with his cardiac surgeon Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VTUIWD</PHI> for two weeks following
discharge from the hospital and to return to see his primary care
physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">CTOJSN</PHI> one to two weeks following discharge from

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PRESYNCOPE.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56 year old black female
with coronary artery disease ,
status post three myocardial infarctions and a coronary artery
bypass graft between the years of 1973 and 1984 , who now came into
the hospital with back pain and one episode of dizziness with a
racing heart. Her cardiac history begins in 1973 when she had her
first myocardial infarction. She has had two more in 1983 and in
1984. She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which her
LIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed to
her obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. The coronary artery
bypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stable
since that time without angina or congestive heart failure
symptoms. She reports that she had a negative exercise tolerance
test one year ago , Holter two to three years ago was reportedly
normal also. The only time the patient recalls having a racing
heart prior to the day of admission was when her brother died two
years ago.
On the day of admission , the patient awoke with a dull ,
nonradiating pain between her shoulder blades that remained until
the patient was given 02 in the Emergency Ward which was
approximately 12 hours after awakening. The patient was never with
this pain before the day of admission. In additional , as the
patient was walking down the street near her home on the morning of
the day of admission , she felt herself stagger , and the world
seemed to rotate around her. She sat down for about 10 minutes
until the spell passed. During this episode , her back pain did not
change in quality or intensity. She had no chest pain , shortness
of breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness ,
trauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. She does report an accompanying
racing heart that seemed regular. After this episode , the patient
drove herself to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> Emergency Ward
for evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had menopause at 42 years of age.
She has never had a mammogram or regular breast exams. The rest of
her review of systems was noncontributory. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft
in 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. She has
had hypertension for ten years. An echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/99</PHI> showed
left ventricular enlargement , inferior apicokinesis , lateral
hypokinesis , and 1+ mitral regurgitation. ALLERGIES: To
Penicillin which leads to anaphylaxis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Were only Isordil and Cardizem. The patient has a 15 pack-year
history of smoking. She quit two months ago. She does not drink
alcohol or abuse IV drugs. She lives alone and is unemployed as an
unemployed LPN , and has one child.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a well developed well nourished
black female very anxious and teary eyed.
Blood pressure on admission was 180/90 in the right arm and 180/95
in the left arm , pulses were equal at 72. She was afebrile at
98.7 , and respirations of 20. She was not orthostatic. The skin
was warm and dry. There were no rashes or bleeding. HEENT exam
was benign. The neck was supple , positive jugular venous
distention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. The
lungs were clear. The back was without costovertebral angle
tenderness or spinal tenderness. Cardiovascular exam: Regular
rate and rhythm with an S3 and a palpable S4 , with a holosystolic
murmur at the apex and a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border. No radiation of either murmur. Her PMI was
diffuse with a sternal heave. Abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities were benign. Pulses: Femoral on the left with a
bruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. The
rest of the pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally. No renal artery bruits
were heard. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented ,
and her exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission showed a normal SMA-7. Her
hematocrit was 41.5 with a low MCV at 78.7 , low
MCH at 31.3 , and a RDW of 16.1. The patient ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with normal CK's. Her chest x-ray showed a
globular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly post
coronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. She had right
atrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but no
evidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. No pulmonary
edema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a PR interval of .14 , QRS
.11 , and a QT of .45. She had left atrial enlargement , old lateral
T-wave inversions as well as inferior T-wave inversions. The
patient had no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Involved placing the patient on a cardiac
monitor , rule her out for an myocardial
infarction , obtaining exercise stress test , echocardiogram , drawing
blood for thyroid function tests , VMA's , metanephrines in the
urine. In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensive
regimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. Her cardiac
monitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few PVC's. The
results of the 24 hour Holter on discharge were still pending. She
ruled out for a myocardial infarction. An exercise stress test
showed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standard
Bruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains.
EKG was with 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in V4 and V5. It was
reportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Because
of this , the patient should probably have an exercise MIBI on the
outside as an outpatient. An echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall ,
2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no
tumor or thrombus was detected.
Laboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated protein
of 8.5 and a globulin fraction of 4.2. Therefore , an S-PEP , IgG
and IgM's were sent and were pending on discharge.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. ,
Cardizem 60 mg q.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , and an
Aspirin a day. The patient was discharged to home in very stable
condition and will followup in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21/08</PHI> at 1:30. A copy of
this discharge should be sent to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">GTCGSG</PHI> , telephone number
<PHI TYPE="PHONE">014-3990</PHI> , who is her primary medical doctor. During her stay here ,
we were not able to get hold of him and notify him of the patient's
status.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Type II diabetes mellitus. 6. Gastroesophageal reflux
disease.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS: The patient had a head MRI ,
an echocardiogram , and head
CT scan.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 61-year-old male was in his usual
state of health until the morning of
admission when he woke up with speech difficulty noticed by his
wife. The patient was noted to make paraphasic errors. In
addition , there was a question of a right facial droop. The
patient presented to the emergency room. There were no other
neurologic symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission revealed
pulse 78 , temperature 98.8 , and blood
pressure 160/78. The patient was in no apparent distress. The
head and neck examination was unremarkable. The neck was supple.
The thyroid gland was not enlarged. The lungs were clear. There
was a normal S1 and S2 , with no murmurs , gallops or rubs. The
abdomen was soft and non-tender. There was no peripheral edema.
The patient was alert and oriented to his name and to place. The
patient had difficulty giving the exact date and month. The
patient was unable to register three objects properly. The
patient's speech was non-fluent with impaired naming. Repetition
was also affected. There was right left confusion , severe
acalculia , as well as poor reading and writing. The patient had no
neglect or apraxia. The patient was able to copy a complicated
figure without problems. The cranial nerves were intact , except
for a mild right upper motor neuron facial palsy. There was no
pronator drift and the strength was 5/5 in all four extremities.
Sensation was intact to primal modalities. The reflexes were 2+
and symmetric with downgoing toes. The patient had normal gait.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission revealed serum
electrolytes to be normal , except for a potassium
of 5.3. The glucose was 168. The white count was 7.8 , hematocrit
38.8 , and platelets 223. A PT and PTT were normal. A head CT scan
showed a subtle hyperdensity in the left frontal region. This was
later confirmed by MRI. The patient had carotid ultrasounds , which
showed a 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. The
right internal carotid was stenosed to 25%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital with a
diagnosis of probable embolic stroke. An MRI
showed a wedge shaped frontal lobe infarct. Clinically , the
patient's speech improved and he regained fluency within the next
24 hours. The patient's naming was relatively preserved.
Comprehension was intact for simple commands. However , the patient
continued to have right left indiscrimination , acalculia , as well
as a defect in reading and writing. The patient was initially
unable to add two plus two , but by the end of the hospitalization ,
he was able to add nine plus six. However , the patient's
calculation never returned to his baseline function. The patient
had an echocardiogram , which revealed an ejection fraction of 60% ,
with no significant valvular disease. There was no thrombus noted
in the left atrium. The patient was started on intravenous Heparin
on admission , and was then converted to oral Coumadin. The patient
ruled out for myocardial infarction on admission. The patient was
kept on a cardiac monitor with no cardiac events noted. The

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16/2906</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old Hispanic
female with insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus and hypertension , who fell at home approximately 1 week
before admission. She suffered a right-sided Colles fracture that
was treated with closed reduction and half cast. Furthermore , she
suffered a nondisplaced left-sided patella fracture , which was
primarily treated with a knee immobilizer. Since the follow-up
x-ray of the distal radius 1 week after trauma showed shortening
and dorsal angulation , the patient was admitted for closed
reduction and external fixation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY reveals
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , anxiety. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY reveals she is status post open reduction and
internal fixation of a left-sided tibial plateau fracture 9 months
ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Verapamil 80 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Chlorthalidone 50 milligrams by mouth per day ,
humulin-N 40 units subcutaneously each morning , multivitamin 1
tablet by mouth per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a 62 year old
female in no acute distress. Lungs were
clear. Cardiovascular examination showed regular rate and rhythm ,
III/VI holosystolic murmur , regular S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities showed the right forearm and wrist immobilized in a
splint , there was regular VMF of all 5 digits , good capillary
refill , radial and ulnar pulses were 2+/2+. Left knee had positive
effusion , no signs of ligamentous instability , straight leg raising
possible , but with 15 to 20 degree extension deficit.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , x-ray of the left knee , PA
and lateral , shows nondislocated patella
fracture ( fracture line almost not visible ). Distal radius PA and
lateral showed shortening and dorsal angulation of the articulate
surface. On admission , electrolytes were within normal limits ,
blood urea nitrogen 23 , creatinine 1.3 , hemoglobin 13.0 , hematocrit
38.2 , white count 8 , 100 , platelet count 411 , 000 , prothrombin time
12.3 , partial thromboplastin time 23.4. Urinalysis was without
pathological findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-9-06</PHI> , the patient underwent closed reduction
and external fixation of her distal radial
fracture. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and the
postoperative course was without complications. Postoperative
x-ray control showed an optimal result with anatomical reduction of
the radial articulate surface. During the early postoperative
course , the radial ramus of the radial nerve seemed to be
irritated , but recovered without any further intervention and the
patient was without any neurological deficit from the 4th
postoperative day on. While the left leg was immobilized with a
brace , the patient started to ambulate with a platform walker and
with full weight-bearing on the left leg. Prior to discharge , the
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. Serial electrolytes ,
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal limits.
Leukocytes were 8 , 000 , hemoglobin 12.9 , hematocrit 38.0 , platelet
count 489 , 000 , last blood glucose level prior to discharge from
7:00 am was 169 , 4:00 pm 73 , 10:00 pm 230. The pin sites on the
right forearm were without signs of infection. X-ray control done
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-15-06</PHI> , showed unchanged positioning of the right radius , as
well as the left patella.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE are the same as on
admission. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The
patient is going home. The plan is for postoperative FOLLOW-UP in
1 week at the Orthopaedic Clinic of <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> .
Until then , the patient is advised to keep the right arm elevated
and to seek medical attention in case of fever , reddening of the
pin sites , and/or secretion from any pin site. Hence , the patient
is not able to do her finger sticks for blood sugar measurement by
herself , and Visiting Nurse Association was ordered.

jerking movements , no incontinence. C/o h/a almost daily for last 3
wks , mostly on L side to post.+ blurry vision.
**PE on discharge: afeb , 80 , 120/70 , not orthostatic. RR 14 , 94-97% RA.
Surgical R pupil. No JVD. RRR S1S2 , III/VI cres/decres ejection murmur at
RUSB. CTAB. +BS , soft NTND. No edema. +gait imbalance.
**Studies: CXR-negative , Head CT-negative. Echo-EF 65-70% , + mild to
moder AS , valve area 1.4 , mean aortic vavle gradient 47. EKG NSR @ 70bpm ,
nml axis/intervals , on ST changes.
**Consults: Neuro ( Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">WIWQT</PHI> ) , Psych ( Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kerri</PHI> ) ,
**Hosp Course by System:
1 ) Cards: Ischemia: Low suspicion for ACS given sxs , however ruled out
for ACS. Pump: Pt with low SBPs on admission in 80s-90s , increased to
120s-130s with hydration. B-blockers , nitrates , ACE-I held on admission
given low BPs. Low dose B-blocker restarted HD 3. ACE-I restarted at
half dose on HD4 given pt's renal dysfunction/hypotension on admission.
Can be uptitrated as outpt. Will continue to hold nitrate for now , may be
restarted by PCP if needed; as currently with SBPs in 120s-130s do not
think pt will tolerate right now. TTE results as described above. Mild to
moderate AS , no indication for surgical correction , very unlikely to be
cause of pt's falling episodes. Pt to follow up with outpt cardiologist.
Rythym: Monitored on telemetry throughout hospitalization. On HD 4 , pt had
short run of NSVT ( 9 beats ) with associated chest tightness lasting for a
few seconds. His vital signs remained stable at this time and an EKG taken
immediately after showed NSR at 67 beats per minute with no changes
from previous ekg's. Given that he was largely asymptomatic with stable
vital signs , has normal EF , his Magnesium was repleted and he will follow
up with his outpt. cardiologist.
2 ) Pulm: On admission pt had roncherous lung exam with normal chest
X-ray. Improvd after neb treatment. O2sats mid to high 90s on RA , with
no O2 requirement during hospitalization.
3 ) Renal: Admitted with Cr of 2.4 , decreased to 1.1 on HD 2 after
hydration. FeNa on admission &lt;1% suggesting pre-renal etiology. Held pt's
NSAIDs given renal failure on admission.
4 ) Neuro: Pt has clear gait instability. Had work-up in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 2005
including MRI/MRA head , neck which were negative. Pt was re-evaluated by
Neurology who felt sxs not indicative of cerebellar disease , felt
possibly post-concussive syndrome. To follow up with outpt Neurologist.
RPR negative. Utox/serum tox negative.
5 ) Heme: Hct 33 ( around baseline ) , anemia work up negative , manual smear
normal. Guiaic negative. Should be followed as outpatient.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/31/2913</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Trimalleolar left ankle fracture.
PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation of left ankle.
DATE OF PROCEDURE: <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 29</PHI> , 1998.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old white
female who slipped on the ice on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 29</PHI> , 1998 , resulting in a trimalleolar left ankle fracture.
She had no other injuries.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Her medications on admission were
Imitrex on a p.r.n. basis.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Migraine headaches.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her vital signs were normal. In general ,
she is a thin white female , in no apparent
distress. HEENT , cardiovascular , pulmonary , and abdominal
examinations were all normal. Her left lower extremity was
neurovascularly intact with obvious deformity. The patient's
radiographic workup demonstrated an isolated left trimalleolar
fracture dislocation. The dislocation was reduced and she was
splinted in the Emergency Room.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent the above noted procedure
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 29</PHI> , 1998. She tolerated this well and
was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition.
Postoperatively , her main problem was nausea. She had minimal pain
in the left foot , and maintained strict elevation. However , she
developed significant nausea and vomiting in the first twenty-four
hours after surgery. This limited her ability to participate in
physical therapy , and she was maintained on intravenous fluids for
twenty-four hours. The nausea resolved over a twenty-four to
thirty-six hour period. Her diet was advanced and she was
tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge. She was
cleared by Physical Therapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 31</PHI> , 1998 , and was discharged
in stable condition to home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Darvocet-N 100 one to two tablets q.4h
p.r.n. for pain. 2. Enteric coated
aspirin one tablet p.o. q.d. x six weeks. 3. She was given
perioperative antibiotics for infection prophylaxis , and aspirin
for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yepes Greg</PHI> in two weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Her condition at the time of discharge is
stable. Her weightbearing status will be
nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity. She was given all
standard cast care instructions and discharged in stable condition
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 31</PHI> , 1998.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/07/2906</PHI>
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UROSEPSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old male
with diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis
and hypertension who had a fever of 102 and shaking chills without
symptoms of upper respiratory infection. He did complain of
intermittent dysuria and he is known to have prostatism. He was
therefore admitted to the Medicine Service. Past medical history
is coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction , diabetes
mellitus , rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. Past surgical
history is negative. He has no known drug allergies. Medications
on admission are Tenormin , Dolobid , Diabinase , Mevacor , Ecotrin ,
Nifedipine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a mildly ill-appearing white male
in no acute distress , afebrile with
stable vital signs. Head and neck are unremarkable. Lungs are
clear. Heart has a regular rate and rhythm with a I/VI
holosystolic murmur. Abdomen is nontender. GU examination on
admission by the Emergency Room internist was not recorded.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission are remarkable for a white
blood cell count of 12.2 thousand ,
creatinine 1.2. Urinalysis had a pH of 5.5 , 1+ leukocyte esterase
and too numerous to count white blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the
diagnosis of urosepsis and placed on
intravenous antibiotics. He was transferred to the urology service
after consideration of his prostatism was made and he would be an
eventual candidate for transurethral resection of the prostate.
During his hospitalization , he promptly defervesced and remained
afebrile for three days. He was therefore changed to oral
antibiotics and observed for 24-hours and because he was stable , he
was felt to be ready for discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is stable. Follow
up is with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hazel Y. Oswalt.</PHI> MEDICATIONS on discharge are
Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , Procardia XL

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27/2906</PHI>
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 42-year-old woman
admitted for treatment of two pulmonary
embolisms and a urinary tract infection.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Pulmonary embolisms times two.
2. Urinary tract infection.
3. Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy.
PRESENT ILLNESS: Twenty years ago the patient suffered a
pulmonary embolism which was poorly
documented after a tubal ligation. She was treated with heparin
and Coumadin. Since that time she has been well. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09-07-06</PHI>
the patient underwent elective total abdominal hysterectomy
secondary to fibroids and menorrhagia. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09-19-06</PHI> , the night
before discharge , the patient noted the onset of sharp pleuritic
chest pain upon movement in bed. It was felt this was musculo-
skeletal and she was discharged. While at home before admission ,
the patient noted some shortness of breath and a temperature to
101. She continued to have a pleuritic chest pain and came to
the emergency room. She was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09-22-06.</PHI>
Past medical history: ( 1 ) Pulmonary embolism. ( 2 ) Cholecys-
tectomy. ( 3 ) Costochondritis. ( 4 ) Status post TAH for
fibroids. ( 5 ) Asthma.
The patient's family history is notable for a cousin with lupus.
The patient doesn't smoke. The patient drinks occasionally.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese women who
appeared tired and was having some
discomfort breathing. Her temperature in the emergency room was
102.5. Her blood pressure was 110/80. Heart rate was 120.
Respirations were 32 which went down to 24 as she calmed down.
Her O2 saturation on room air was 99%. An ABG was not done. Head
was unremarkable. Neck was supple. Lungs were clear without a
rub. Cardiac exam shows regular rate and rhythm without murmurs
appreciated. Abdomen was soft and has bowel sounds. The wound
had its dressing in place and there was a small amount of
serosanguinous drainage appreciated. It was nontender.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits.
BUN 6 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 114 ,
white count 12.2 , hematocrit 26 , platelets 508 , 000. PT 13.4 , PTT
25.6. Chest x-ray showed bilateral basilar atelectasis. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia at 104 with normal interval and axis.
There was T-wave inversion in 3 and V1 without other ST-T wave
changes. VQ scan obtained prior to admission was read as low
probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and started on
heparin. The PTT was quickly thera-
peutic. The patient had informal noninvasive studies , mainly
ultrasound of the thighs which failed to show deep venous
thrombosis. She , therefore , underwent on the second hospital day
pulmonary angiography which showed two small pulmonary embolisms
on the left side. In the meantime , her VQ scan had been reinter-
preted as showing intermediate probability with notch defect on
left and right. The patient had been started on Coumadin.
In the meantime , after her procedure she developed a procedure.
She had some dysuria. Her urine had white cells and bacteria and
eventually grew out Enterobacter aerogenes. In the meantime she
was treated with ceftizoxime and defervesced and was converted to
p.o. Bactrim and remained afebrile. The Enterobacter was sensi-
tive to this antibiotic. The patient was discharged on 1 mg
p.o. q. h.s. of Coumadin with a PT the preceding day of 19.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition is good.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to the
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Isbell Methodist</PHI> under the care of
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Winston Andre</PHI> who is the patient's primary care physician.
A PT will need to be checked on arrival. Most likely the
patient's PT will be in the range of 18 to 20 and she will need
approximately 1 mg p.o. of Coumadin.
Discharge medications: Bactrim one double strength tablet p.o.
b.i.d.; iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.d.; Motrin 800 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q. h.s.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Imogene Valladares</PHI> , M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">ITGNS</PHI> is a 51-year-old man who
was recently admitted for repair of left pseudoaneurysm in his
groin. He was in home and doing fine after discharge from
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/16/2918.</PHI> One week later , he
noticed pus draining from his wound site. He was doing daily
dressing changes at home. He was seen in Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vincenza.</PHI> 's office on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">11/1/2918</PHI> with only mild improvement. He was admitted from
clinic for more aggressive management. He has no history of
fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation , or diarrhea. No
chest pain and no shortness of breath.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was afebrile. Vital sings are
stable. He is 100% on room air. He had on the left , 2+ femoral ,
no DP , monophasic PT pulse with cold foot. On the right , TMA ,
warm foot , femoral 2+ , DP monophasic , PT monophasic. Wound site
with some erythema and drainage , nontender , no odor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status
post CABG , peripheral vascular disease status post aortobifemoral
bypass and status post femoropopliteal bypass , COPD , chronic
renal failure , and diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Repair of pseudoaneurysm.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg once a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a
day; Zestril 2.5 mg once a day; Ultralente 14 mg q.a.m. , 4 mg
q.p.m.; Zocor 10 mg once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Imdur 30
mg once a day; torsemide 100 mg once a day; and Dilaudid p.r.n.
ALLERGY: He has an allergy to penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: One pack a day smoker. Occasional alcohol.
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was admitted for IV
antibiotics and further surgical therapy with the diagnosis of
dehiscence of left thigh bypass graft wound. He received
wet-to-dry dressing changes t.i.d. initially. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/08/2918</PHI> , he
was taken to the operating room for left groin closure with flap
by Plastic Surgery and Vascular Surgery. The flap initially was
pink and viable , however , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/09/2918</PHI> , there were noted some
pale areas and mottling of the flap. He was injected with
heparin solution. Following this , flap received serial needle
pricks and the appearance gradually improved as such there was no
further pallor or mottling. The patient developed diarrhea. He
was on vancomycin , levofloxacin , with p.o. Flagyl for empiric
treatment for C. diff. C. diff cultures were negative on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">11/15/2918</PHI> , in addition his drain cultures on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/2/2918</PHI> , showed
rare Staphylococcus aureus. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/08/2918</PHI> , repeat culture of

100 mg b.i.d. with goal diuresis of 1-2 liters per day. IV Lasix
was added p.r.n. to achieve this goal. After his episode of
nausea , his EKG was checked to rule out any sort of cardio
ischemic cause for this nausea , EKG was normal. His morphine was
discontinued as a possible cause. He did well with p.o. pain
medications. Renal: His Zestril was held secondary to an
elevation in creatinine to 3.3 from his baseline of 1.8. This
gradually resolved. Creatinine was 2.5 at the time of discharge.
The patient was also seen by the Nutrition and recommended
supplements , vitamin C , and Zinc for wound healing. By

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
38 year old woman with a hx of aplastic anemia s/p
fall with hypersomnoloence and facial trauma. Pt dx with aplastic
anemia at age 12 and has been chronically transfusion dependent since
then. Baseline hct 23-25 and platelets 9-teens.
Has developed hemochromatosis 2/2 transfusions.
Pt apparently fell asleep while standing up the
night prior to admission. She landed on her face
and developed a hematoma. Head CT and
mandibular X-rays negative. Pain med managment a major
issue as she is on methadone 90 tid at
baseline as well as taking numerous others prn.
Course by problem:
1. Aplastic Anemia: Pt initial platelets less than 10 with a hct of 18.
She was transfused 2 units platelets and 2 units PRBCs. Platelets did
not bump much and she was transfused an additional 2 units platelets.
PLatlets the night prior to admission were 35. Hemostasis achieved of
wounds and hct bumped to 23.
2. Fall: Fall has been attributed to hypersomnolence , likely due to
over use of narcotics and possible a sleep disorder. Pt did become
more alert during admission once pain meds changed and pt got some
sleep.
3. Pain: Pain consultant recommended changing her to the regimen of
methadone 30 tid with oxycodone 5-10 q3hr prn. She did well on this
regimen with minimal breakthrough pain.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Pseudogout.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Fever.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Hypertension , urinary tract infection , and
diabetes.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wiggins Teddy</PHI> is a
77-year-old female with past medical history notable for
diabetes , urinary incontinence , hypertension and chronic low back
pain who was recently discharged to rehab from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/13/20</PHI> after a hospitalization which
included medical ICU stay for urosepsis and left lower lobe
pneumonia. During that hospitalization , she developed the issues
with infection but eventually got better and was discharged on
the <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/13/20.</PHI> At rehab , she initially did well but then
developed on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17/20</PHI> fever to 101 and a white count up to
27. She also had some diaphoresis on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19/20.</PHI> The patient
and the daughter report that she had been improving steadily
until this point. Given the development of these symptoms , while
on levofloxacin and Flagyl since her last discharge , she was
transferred back to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> Emergency Department
for further workup. In the emergency department , her temperature
was 101. The labs were remarkable for white count 27 without
bands , hematocrit of 32.1 , creatinine 1.3 up from her baseline of
1. A urinalysis showed white blood cells too numerous to count
and 2+ bacteria with 3+ yeast. Chest x-ray in the emergency
department showed no definite consolidation and no definite acute
process. At that time , she was alert and oriented. She received
Tylenol , levofloxacin , Flagyl and cefuroxime in the Emergency
Department. Of note , the patient and the daughter report that
the Foley catheter than was present upon discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> had not been changed at the rehab.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: In terms of her past medical history ,
diabetes secondary to pancreatectomy in the setting of alcohol
abuse in 1959 , multiple mechanical falls in the past 6 to 7
months , spinal stenosis , C3-C4 compression along with cervical
spondylosis , L2-L3 cord compression , gait instability ,
osteoarthritis of the right acromioclavicular joint , shoulders ,
elbows and hands , urinary incontinence , senile dementia , chronic
diarrhea , hypertension , peptic ulcer disease , history of GI
bleed , depression , PPD positive , history of shingles ,
nephrolithiasis , pyelonephritis in 2003 , iron deficiency anemia ,
status post cholecystectomy 2003 and status post splenectomy.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies are to Naprosyn where she develops GI
bleed from that.
MEDICATIONS: Her meds on transfer from rehab were Lopressor ,
metronidazole , levofloxacin , nifedipine , glucagon , Lantus ,
heparin , Pancreas , protein supplement , calcium , Senna , PhosLo ,
iron , Effexor , Nexium , and Paxil.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her family history is noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is retired , used to work at a saloon. She
is status post discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Yanira Innocent Garret Hinton.</PHI> for
management of pain due to cervical spondylosis. She is widowed ,
two children , does not live alone. Quit smoking 20 years ago.
No alcohol since early 80s. No illicit drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , her temperature was 101
down to 97.9 on the floor. Heart rate in the 70s , respiratory
rate 12 , BP 157/75. In general , she was alert , oriented ,
uncomfortable , and easily conversant. HEENT exam: No
lymphadenopathy. Pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Pulmonary exam shows soft bibasilar crackles bilaterally worse on
the left. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1
and S2 , 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right sternal border
without radiation. JVP was less than 10. Peripheral pulses full
and symmetric. Abdomen was soft , nondistended , positive bowel
sounds. No tenderness. She had diffuse edema of her lower
extremities bilaterally and lower extremities were also tender to
palpation. Her perineum showed tender erythematous area of
induration surrounding her labia and anus with adherent white
plaques. Neuro: Cranial nerves II through XII intact. Range of
motion on lower extremities is limited by pain.
LABS ON ADMISSION: 27.6 white count and 32.1 hematocrit.
Glucose of 57. Blood smear showed 1+ target cells , ____ , and
tear drops.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted to the floor.
1. ID. She was initiated on cefuroxime q.12h. , levofloxacin ,
and Flagyl. Urine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 yeast ,
likely explained by persistent Foley catheter and perineal yeast
infection. Her Foley was changed upon admission to the floor.
Blood culture was negative as was the stool culture. The patient
continued to be febrile and had elevated white count despite
antibiotic therapy without fevers , so the antimicrobial therapy
was discontinued on hospital day #3. Evaluation by the
Infectious Disease team with further studies did not yield a
clear source of infection. Therefore , Rheumatology consult was
called.
2. Rheumatology: Evaluation by the Rheumatology Service lead to
joint aspirations performed in the right MCP and right knee
joints , which revealed fluid with around 2000 white blood cells
and both negatively by refringent and positively by refringent
crystals consistent with gout and pseudogout. DVT was ruled out
as a cause of this extremity swelling. The patient was started
on Colchicine with improvement of pain and decrease of joint
swelling. An intraarticular ankle injection of Depo-Medrol was
performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/24/20</PHI> with good affect. By the <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/25/20</PHI> , the
patient reported marked improvement in her range of motion and
pain control.
3. Endocrine: The patient was initially maintained on her rehab
dose of insulin which was Lantus 18 units at night , aspart 4
units at meals plus a sliding scale of Novolog. However , due to
intermittent decreased p.o. intake , she suffered several episodes
of hypoglycemia with blood sugars in the 30s to 50s. Her insulin
dosing was titrated initially downward and then after she
increased her p.o. intake it was titrated upwards. Pancreatic
enzymes were given with meals.
4. Cardiovascular: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">T Dixie</PHI> blood pressure was persistently
elevated on her rehab regimen of antihypotensive medication.
Control was achieved in house by titrating her metoprolol up to
75 mg q.i.d. and adding Captopril at 50 mg t.i.d. No hypotension
while in house.
5. Neurologic: Her mental status initially declined at the
beginning of hospitalization. But by hospital day #3 , she began
to improve and became more coherent and alert. Her pain was
controlled on admission as well by both oxycodone and colchicine.
CT myelography was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/25/20</PHI> to evaluate the
patient's spinal stenosis disease. Results are still pending at
the time of this dictation.
6. Renal: Her electrolytes and renal functions were followed
closely in the setting of a recent urosepsis during the last
admission , her creatinine remained less than 1.2 throughout her
hospitalization and her electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
Urine output remained sufficient.
PLAN: Plan was for discharge in stable condition to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wynona Graig</PHI> with instructions to follow up her PCP , <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Olds Vincenza</PHI> , in one
to two weeks after discharge.
CODE STATUS: Full.
Daughter is her health care proxy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Will be dictated at the time of
discharge.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/1/2905</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a vigorous , healthy
79-year-old retired garment industry
worker followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leslie Pattie</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI>
for the question of transient ischemic attacks but is otherwise
well. On the night of admission , the patient and his wife noted
fatigue , lightheadedness and diaphoresis three different times
during the day. The patient took one to two ounces of ethanol to
relieve this discomfort. Several hours later , attempting to climb
stairs , the patient fell and was unable to get up. Soon after , he
had an episode of melenic soft stool in large volume without frank
blood and then a moderate amount of coffee ground emesis. The
emergency medical technicians were called. In the ambulance , Mr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">TGUTK'N</PHI> heart rate was 110 with a blood pressure of 110/68. At the
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanbuskirk &Wiggins;Araceli/Dianne</PHI> Emergency Ward , his blood pressure had dropped to
95/60 and he was symptomatically orthostatic.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) was performed in the Emergency
Room which showed an actively bleeding 1 cm antral lesion in the
greater curvature of the stomach which was cauterized. This was
felt to be consistent with a pancreatic rest versus leiomyoma
versus rarely metastatic lesion as well as some mild esophagitis.
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">TGUTK</PHI> had no previous history of peptic ulcer disease. He has
been taking aspirin , one to two per day for several months because
of a question of TIA and for hip pain. He does have a history of
daily ethanol use , approximately two to three ounces per day times
many years. There was no history of nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
weight loss , abdominal pain , anorexia , or other constitutional
symptoms. There was a remote history of abdominal pain and spastic
colon with a negative barium enema , upper GI series and abdominal
ultrasound in 1976. He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was transfused with 5
units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and vital signs
stabilized. He was then transferred to the General Medical Service
with a stable hematocrit at 37. It had been as low as 21 in the
MICU. MEDICATIONS: On admission included aspirin , two po q day
and steroid cream to the psoriatic area. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Noteable for chronic psoriasis. Vertigo with question of TIA.
Status post multiple excisions of basal cell skin carcinoma.
History of hiatal hernia with a question of reflux esophagitis.
Status post suprapubic prostatectomy many years ago because of BPH.
Status post herniorrhaphy. Status post appendectomy. History of
glucose intolerance , diet controlled. Status post right cataract
removal with lens implantation. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN MEDICAL
ALLERGIES. FAMILY HISTORY: Multiple siblings healthy in their
late 80's. Positive family history of pancreatic CA in brother.
History of hypertension in mother and sister. No history of
coronary artery disease , diabetes , tuberculosis , hepatic or renal
disease. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired womens clothing
manufacturer. He lives with his wife in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</PHI> He has a moderate
ethanol use and has not used tobacco for 30 years. REVIEW OF
SYSTEMS: Negative except for vertigo.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: After stabilization revealed a 79-year-old
looking remarkably well and fit. Vital
signs revealed a heart rate of 60 , blood pressure 132/70.
Temperature 98. Skin revealed multiple patches of psoriasis. Head
and neck revealed normal pupils. Extraocular movements were intact
except for slight decrease in upward gaze mobility. The oropharynx
was benign. Neck was normal. Chest was clear. Cardiac
examination revealed S4 , S1 , S2 , no S3. A slow murmur heard on
admission was absent after transfusion. Abdomen was soft , flat
without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities revealed pulses to be
intact without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Stool was positive.
Neurological exam was grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant data included as mentioned , the
hematocrit down to 21 which became stable at 37.
There was also evidence of mild pyuria and hematuria. Otherwise ,
some mild elevations of liver enzymes were noted toward the end of
his hospitalization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent the following studies
including a repeat EGD which showed in the antrum
a 1 cm area along the greater curvature which was ulcerated with
raised borders. Biopsies were not taken of that lesions , however ,
biopsies of large folds distal to the antrum in the duodenum were
biopsied. The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan which showed
question of small cystic lesion in the pancreas , either ductal
dilatation or a cyst but almost certainly an incidental finding
without any evidence of intraabdominal malignancy. Upper GI series
performed on the following day again showed thickened gastric folds
but was unremarkable. The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1/05</PHI> on the
following medications: Pepcid , 20 mg po b.i.d.; steroid cream for
psoriasis. Follow-up will be arranged with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">QGMSG</PHI> and Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Pearline , Lourdes</PHI> The patient was in stable condition upon discharge.

ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Denver , Utzinger</PHI> MD
CONSULTS: Consults for this patient included Urology and
Cardiology.
PROCEDURES: Procedures for this patient included a urological
procedure with placement of a ureteral stent and subsequent
removal of the ureteral stent.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission included Lasix 20 mg
b.i.d. , OxyContin 90 b.i.d. and 40 q. 2 p.m. , lisinopril 40
daily , Norvasc 5 b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 b.i.d. , Levoxyl 88 mcg ,
Ativan 0.5 at bedtime , Niferex 150 b.i.d. , Colace b.i.d. ,
lactulose 50 daily , Faslodex 250 IM q. month , Coumadin 5 daily ,
Zometa q. month , Fosamax 70 q. week , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies included penicillin , which resulted in
pruritus and a rash.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old woman with a
history of rheumatic heart disease , status post St. Jude's mitral
valve repair as well as AV and TV repair who has CHF at baseline
with an EF of 40% to 45% as well as metastatic breast cancer and
a recent history of hydronephrosis who initially presented with
chest discomfort with exertion that resolved with rest. The
chest pain started five days prior to admission , which is
described as a 7 or 8 out of 10 associated with nausea and
shortness of breath , but the patient denied any radiation of the
pain , any vomiting , or any diaphoresis. She also said that she
had PND and orthopnea at baseline and she had recently increased
her number of pillows that she sleeps on , from two to three. Her
weight had been stable with no change in diet. She ruled out for
an MI; however , given her hydronephrosis , thought to be secondary
to her metastatic cancer and her rise in creatinine , it was
decided to place a ureteral stent , which was done by the Urology
Service. However , after the stent was placed , she developed
severe pain , fever , and increased white blood cell count.
Although the fever and white blood cell count resolved , she
continued to feel pain , and it was decided to remove the ureteral
stent since it was not decreasing her creatinine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable
for a blood pressure of 168/94. Other vitals included a
temperature 97.2 , pulse 69 , respiratory rate 16 , and saturating
98% on room air. Her JVP was 9. She had left lower lung
crackles , otherwise clear. She has a very loud ejection murmur ,
loud S1 and S2. She was in atrial fibrillation with a
irregularly irregular heart rate with no rub and she had a 1 to
2+ edema bilaterally and she was trace guaiac positive.
PROBLEM LIST BY SYSTEM:
Heart: Ischemia: She had a negative MIBI and her A and B sets
of troponins were negative , however her C set was 0.14 , which was
thought to be an error. Her aspirin and statin were continued.
Pump: Her EF was 35% to 40%. She was kept on hydralazine ,
Lasix , and beta-blocker , and her digoxin was stopped due to
bradycardia during this admission. In terms of her valves , she
has a St. Jude valve as well as other valve abnormalities and her
INR goal was 2 to 3. She was taken off her Coumadin for her
stent procedure and then bridged with heparin for a PTT goal of
60 to85. Her Coumadin was restarted and we waited until she was
therapeutic at an INR above 2 before she was discharged. Rate:
She is normally in atrial fibrillation. She developed
bradycardia for several days , which was though to be a
combination of some Lopressor given to her in ED when she was
having her rule out as well as slightly elevated levels of
digoxin. Her dioxin was stopped. Her beta-blocker was stopped
and then restarted at a lower dose. By discharge , she was
tolerating low-dose Lopressor. During the hospital stay , on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/3/20</PHI> she had 10 beats of VT during which she was
asymptomatic. Her blood pressure was stable.
Renal: She had acute renal failure on admission and as I had
dictated previously she had a ureteral stent placed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/3/20</PHI>
and that was then removed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/4/20</PHI> because of her severe pain.
Endocrine: She was kept on her Levoxyl.
Heme: She was guaiac positive , and her stools were guaiaced and
her hematocrit was monitored. Although it dropped initially , it
did not drop further during the hospital stay. She was kept on
her home pain control medications and she required additional
pain medications when she had her stent placed.
Psych: She continued her home medications.
GI: She stayed on her lactulose and Colace and bowel regimen was
titrated to bout BM's.
DISPOSITION: She was stable on the day of discharge. She was
discharged to home , I believe , with VNA.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her medications on the day of discharge
were Coumadin 6 q.p.m. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20

ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nicola , Woods I.O.</PHI> M.D.
HOSPITAL COURSE: For the events of the earlier part of the
hospitalization , please see the dictation by the Vascular Surgery
team. The patient was transferred to the Medical Service for
further management on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/28/22.</PHI> Briefly , this is a 59-year-old
female with diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
history of recurrent MRSA infections including vertebral osteo
status post compression fracture and fusion admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/17/22</PHI> from rehab after rupture of her
right forearm AV fistula. The patient underwent surgical
ligation of her brachial artery. The patient had a significant
drop in her hematocrit to 14 , and she received several units of
packed red blood cells and underwent surgical ligation of the
brachial artery. She subsequently remained intubated on Levophed
in the Surgical ICU. She was then weaned off Levophed and
transferred to the Surgery Service. The patient completed a
course of linezolid for treatment of her recent bacteremia , which
ended on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/25/22.</PHI> She was started on fluconazole 400 mg once
daily for treatment of recent candidemia , course ending <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/4/22</PHI> ,
and she was also started on vancomycin 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
ongoing suppressive treatment of recurrent C. diff. The
patient's hospital course was subsequently complicated by severe
deconditioning , refeeding syndrome , poor nutritional status and
decubitus ulcers.

ligation.
Hospital course complicated by severe deconditioning , poor
nutritional status and decubitus ulcers.
1. Infectious disease: The patient started to become afebrile
48 hours after transfer to the Medical Service with temperatures
as high as 102.5. Vital signs were stable. Blood cultures are
still no growth to date. Chest x-ray without any evidence of
infiltrate. The patient is anuric , likely source decubitus
ulcers versus recurrent osteo. Blood cultures were obtained on a
daily basis , which were no growth today at the time of this
dictation. Fluconazole and vancomycin p.o. were continued ,
course ending on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/4/22.</PHI> The ID. Service was asked to consult
for further help with management of the patient's fevers.
Plastics consult was obtained to evaluate decubitus ulcers.
.
2. Renal: The patient was followed by Renal Service and had
dialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays.
3. GI: The patient was maintained on Reglan for gastroparesis
and continued on Nexium.
4. Heme: The patient had guaiac-positive stools. Her
hematocrit was 28 and dropped to 25.8 upon transfer. She
received two units of packed red blood cells transfusion on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/3/22</PHI> during dialysis.
5. Endocrine: The patient had uncontrolled hyperglycemia likely
secondary to the stress of her hospitalization. She was
initially on 40 units of NPH b.i.d. and this was titrated up to
maintain normal glycemia.
6. Derm: She had decubitus ulcers followed by the wound care
nurse , <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Oswald Vanhouten.</PHI> She was continued on Panafil and XenoDerm.
A Plastics consult was obtained regarding need for further
debridement.
7. FEN: The patient's course was complicated by refeeding
syndrome with severe electrolyte imbalances requiring aggressive
repletion of her electrolytes including phos , K and mag. She was
maintained on tube feeds. A Speech and Swallow evaluation was
obtained , which determined that she can be started on pureed
diet. However , it was unlikely that she would be able to
maintain adequate p.o. intake.
8. Prophylaxis The patient was maintained on heparin prophylaxis
for DVT and Nexium given her guaiac-positive stools.
At time of this dictation , the plan is for a family meeting to
discuss the patient's prognosis , nutritional status and goals of
care.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/20/2908</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old right
handed man who was admitted to the
neurology service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/3/08.</PHI> He has a two week history of right
sided slowly improving. The neurology service felt that the
findings on exam was most consistent with cervical disc disease and
they asked neurosurgery to consult. In brief , the patient's chief
complaint is right sided weakness. The patient was in his usual
state of health until approximately three and a half weeks prior to
admission. He noted pain in his right shoulder over four to five
hours , the pain increased. He also noted numbness in his right
toes. His right hand was weak as well and he had difficulty
holding a cup. Conservative management failed , i.e. , bedrest. He
came to the emergency room at the request of his local doctor and
was admitted to the neurology service. While here , on Decadron ,
Motrin and Flexeril , he noted some improvement. Of note , he fell
flat on his face first on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/14/07</PHI> and sustained a sprained ankle.
At that time , he had no back or neck pain. While in house , he felt
that he could walk three times around the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</PHI> At that point , he
experienced weakness and numbness on the fourth trip around. He
has also noted some urgency since the onset of his neck pain. He
has normal peroneal sensation except for the transient occurrences
of some saddle distribution of abnormal sensation. He has
constipation which has now improved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: L4-5
laminectomy in 1970 and 1982. In 1980 , he had a perforated ulcer.
In 1982 , he had surgery for a hiatal hernia. In 1983 , he had a
cholecystectomy. In 1984 , he had a partial gastrectomy and
colectomy for swallowing a toothpick. He has a history of anxiety
attacks related to highway driving. He is a past smoker , stopped
seven years ago after three packs per day times 40 years. History
of alcohol abuse but does not drink now. He has no cardiac ,
respiratory or GI disturbances.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed the patient to be
afebrile. Vital signs were stable. General
exam was within normal limits. He had full range of motion with
increased pain with extension of his neck. He was alert and
oriented with a normal mental status. Speech was fluent with no
dysarthria. Cranial nerves were entirely within normal limits. He
had no pronator drift. On the left he was 5/5 throughout. On the
right he had 5- strength in his biceps , triceps , wrist extensors
and intrinsics. Hip flexors were 4/5. Knee flexors and knee
extensors were 4/5. He was essentially 5/5 throughout the rest of
his lower extremities. His reflexes were 1-2+ in his upper
extremities and approximately 3+ at the knees with downgoing toes.
He had 3-4 beat clonus on the right. Coordination was okay
bilaterally. Gait tested revealed a tendency to fall with
decreased ability to weight bear on the right. Sensory exam
revealed decreased sensation in the right hand and the last three
digits of the left hand. He had no subjective numbness in his
right leg , on the dorsum of his left foot , he had decreased
sensation with a cut off before the toes.
MRI was a poor quality study which showed C5-6 and C6-7 disc bulge.
CAT scan showed severe stenosis of C6-7 with osteophyte , moderate
stenosis at C5-6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sandoval Goodman</PHI> who agreed
with the plan for C5-6 and C6-7 laminectomies.
He was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/12/08.</PHI> Preoperative
diagnosis with cervical stenosis with myelopathy. Postoperative
diagnosis was the same. The procedure was C4-5 , C5-6 , C6-7
laminectomy. He had a Hemovac placed postoperatively. The
estimated blood loss was less than 100 cc. Postoperatively , he did
very well. He had good upper extremity strength which seemed to
improve. He was seen by physical therapy. He had a slightly
swollen calf and had noninvasive vascular studies of his lower
extremities which were negative. He did , however , note some
shooting pain in his left lower extremity. His wound was clean and
healing well. He was out of bed with a walker. The plan was for
discharge home. He may need further evaluation of his lumbar spine
at some point but he seems to be doing well with Percocet only.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cyrus Ureno</PHI> , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
End-stage renal disease and osteomyelitis.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , peripheral neuropathy , left
Charcot foot complicated by ulceration requiring partial
thickness debridement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/10/21</PHI> in the setting of new Aircast
started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/07/21</PHI> now with a cast applied to the left foot ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia , spinal
stenosis , anemia of chronic disease , thrombocytopenia , and ascus
<PHI TYPE="DATE">9/2916</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/2919.</PHI>
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with chronic renal
insufficiency , baseline creatinine 3.8 , diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , and anemia , who present with two weeks of diffuse
abdominal pain that acutely worsened one day prior to admission
with associated nausea , nonbloody emesis , and chills. The
patient was found to be febrile with leukocytosis in the ED. The
patient had been seen previously in the ED on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/19/21</PHI> at which
time she was treated with a UTI. She was sent home with a
seven-day course of ciprofloxacin and oxycodone for pain. The
ciprofloxacin was renally dosed. The patient reports that she
stopped taking oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. After developing
constipation , it is unclear if she completed her full course of
antibiotics. She currently present with complaints of diarrhea
in the setting of having taken laxative at home. No melena or
hematochezia. The pain is not related to food , urination , or
defecation. She has poor p.o. intake , denies any sick contacts
at home. No recent travel.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Positive for blood sugars ranging from 180-190 , although she had
a blood sugar of 499 on the morning of admission. She has
fatigue but no myalgias , no cough , chest pain , shortness of
breath , no dysuria. In the ED , she was given ampicillin 2 g IV ,
gentamicin 80 mg IV , Flagyl 500 mg IV and 8 units of insulin.
ALLERGIES:
Medication reaction , she has an allergy to lisinopril with
reaction of elevated creatinine at a low dose. To levofloxacin ,
she has reflux and celecoxib gives her dizziness and elevated
creatinine.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She had a temperature of 101 , pulse of 106 , blood pressure
172/71 , oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was alert and
oriented x3 , in mild distress. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 early systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. She was obese , but had a nontender , nondistended abdomen
with normal abdominal bowel sounds. She was guaiac negative , and
her left foot was in a cast.
PERTINENT LABORATORY TESTS AND RESULTS:
She had a sodium of 127 , corrected to 131 with her glucose ,
potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of 27 , BUN 95 , creatinine 4.5 ,
glucose 329. LFTs were normal , amylase 19 , lipase 8 , negative
keto acids in the serum and urine. Her white blood count was
26.8 , INR was 1.4 , PTT was 36.6. She had a dirty urinalysis.
She had an abdominal CT that showed a non-incarcerated hernia , no
evidence of colitis.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
The patient had a debridement of her left foot on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/3/21.</PHI> She
also had hemodialysis initiated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/2/21.</PHI>
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious disease: The patient's left foot was encasted by
orthopedics surgery on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/30/21</PHI> with evidence of underlying
infection. Her wound cultures grew MRSA with probes to the bone.
X-rays were unrevealing and MRI showed severe osteomyelitis. In
addition , the patient had an ESR of 109. The patient was thus
put on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl. Blood cultures from
<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/31/21</PHI> additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters which
eventually yielded MRSA. However , surveillance cultures with
treatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl were negative.
The patient received debridement of her left foot on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/3/21.</PHI>
In the OR , the bone looked necrotic and infected. The bone was
sent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which are
pending. Given the appearance of her bone during debridement , it
is presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.
Because she did have a clear source of fevers after it was found
that she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued off
Flagyl and levofloxacin on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/06/21.</PHI>
2. GI: The patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptying
study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/31/21</PHI> showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistent
with severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. Radiology did not
feel that an upper GI series would give further information
regarding obstruction and it was judged to be unlikely given that
the patient has bowel movements and rare emesis. Later on in the
hospital course , the patient was put on erythromycin with a
decrease in her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting.
The patient did have any evidence of bowel ischemia on MRA.
Later , erythromycin was changed to Reglan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/4/21</PHI> per renal
request during hemodialysis. There is no evidence of pancreatis
or liver disease and the patient was also kept on Compazine for
nausea.
3. Renal: The patient had , on admission , acute on chronic renal
failure. There was a concern for prerenal azotemia in the
setting of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. She had a
fractional excretion of sodium which was 0.3% , but it was
difficult to interpret in the setting of end-stage renal disease.
Lasix and Cozaar were held. However , the creatinine continued
to worsen reaching 6.1 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/1/21.</PHI> Renal was consulted
regarding the need for dialysis. On admission , the patient did
have matured AV fistula graft and she was thus started on
hemodialysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/2/21.</PHI>
4. Hematology: The patient had an INR which was elevated.
Hematocrit was also decreased to 25.5 from 34. She was guaiac
negative and did have any schistocyte. Her LDH was also normal
with her haptoglobin high. It was judged from her iron studies
that the patient was iron deficient. She was put on iron
supplementation. She also was felt to have renal component to
her anemia and she was started on darbepoetin initially and
changed to erythropoietin later during dialysis by renal.
5. Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on aspirin , a
statin , and calcium channel blocker. She started prophylactic
beta-blocker during her hospital course as well.
6. Endocrine: The patient had hemoglobin A1c of 7.8. She was
transitioned to NPH and Aspart during her hospital stay. She had
intermittent problems with hypoglycemia in the setting of being
NPO pending operations and procedures; however , her insulin
regimen was titrated to good glycemic response.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on heparin and Nexium.
8. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: Her IV fluids were
stopped as the patient was oliguric and anuric initially before
hemodialysis. Later on , she was also put on 1500 mL fluid
restriction. Later on during dialysis , her volume status
resolved euvolemia. She was kept on a low fat and low
cholesterol diabetic diet. The patient is full code.

LABS: Creatinine of 2.2 that dropped to 1.5 with hydration ( BL
1.2-1.3 ). HCT 41.6 with drop after aggresive hydration. Lipase of 132
but has chronic pancreatitis and is now normalizing. UA and ACE
negative.
ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 YO male with complicated PMH admitted with
hyperglycemia likely due to non-compliance and hypotension likely due
to hypovolemia. In ED the patient received 5 liters of IVF and 36U of
insulin. His blood pressure stabilized with volume and he was
transfered to the medical floor.
ENDOCRINE - DMII but with history of pancreatitis so behaves more like
type 1 - needs insulin all the time. Per patient he had been taking 20
units of Lantus QAM but patient admitted to poor compliance with both
diet and insulin. His A1C was checked and returned at 19. The patient
was started on Lantus and Lispro and maintained on an ADA diet. He was
titrated to 20 units of Lantus QHS and was requring Lispro for FS
ranging from 120-600. By <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/18</PHI> his FS remained better controlled but
were still high ranging from 200 to 400 on Lantus 16. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/19</PHI> the
patient expressed that he would like to leave. He is discharged o
n Lantus 20 and Lispro SS with VNA to follow finger sticks. He
was maintained on an ADA diet , however , there was some concern he
may have been eating sweets on his own. Nutrition was consulted
and provided teaching regaring diet and diabetes. The patient is
discharged to home on Lantus and lispro with VNA following
HEME - on coumadin for hx of pacer clot. Echo shows pacer clot but
not clear whether patient will be compliant enough to go home on
coumadin as he has not been in the past. After discussion with
patient agreement is that we will d/c on coumadin 5 QD ( INR on
day of d/c 1.2 ) with enough supply for one week. He will have
blood drawn by VNA with results sent to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Essie.</PHI> If he his not
compliant with his lab work the coumadin will be stopped.
CV -
ISCHEMIA: Nonobstuctive CAD on cath in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> with no evidence
of acute episode. Maintained on ASA , ACEi , and Statin. No BB as
current cocaine user and considered to dangerous
PUMP: EF: 20-25% Hypovolemic at admission with good response to
hydration. No episodes of volume overload. On ACEi for AL reduction.
RHYTHM: CHB with PPM in place
GI: elevated lipase with chronic pancreatitis with no symptoms and
resolution after hydration.
DISPO: The patient is discharged to home in fair condition. He has been
given teaching regarding nutrition , diabetes , and coumadin. His
medications has been discussed with him. He agrees to be compliant with
all medications , to work with VNA , and to attend all of his
appointments and blood draws. He is discharged home on coumadin and

saturation of 97% on room air and a temperature of 98.2. Her skin
was pale. Her HEENT examination was pale conjunctiva , anicteric
sclerae. Her cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm. Her
lungs were clear to auscultation. Her abdomen was soft and
non-distended with a palpable mass at the level of the umbilicus ,
non-tender. Her pelvic speculum examination revealed a large
running of clot in the vault. The cervix was not able to be
visualized. Bimanual examination revealed a 2-3 centimeter dilated
cervix with a palpable fibroid prolapsing through the os of the
uterus with additional 20 week size and irregular. Her hematocrit
on presentation was 31.
Given her symptoms and heavy bleeding with an aborting prolapsing
fibroid and hemodynamic instability , the patient was taken to the Operating
Room for a total abdominal hysterectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 8</PHI> , 1997 at 12:30 a.m.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 8</PHI> , 1997 at 12:30 a.m. she underwent

one unit intraoperatively. Please see the operative report for details of that
surgery. However , notably , she had an 18 week size fibroid uterus with
multiple large fibroids including an eight centimeter submucosal
fibroid prolapsing through the cervix. Her tubes and ovaries were
normal. Her appendix was normal. Her liver edge and kidneys were
normal. Both ureters were identified peristalsing at the beginning
and at the end of the case.
Her postoperative course was relatively unremarkable. A
postoperative hematocrit in the PACU was 32.1 after one unit of
intraoperative packed cells. On postoperative day #1 , her
hematocrit stabilized at 27.7. She was discharged home in good

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Ventricular fibrillation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Noreen</PHI> is a 75-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% status post ICD
and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis who was
admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 21</PHI> , 2005 after his ICD fired at home for
ventricular fibrillation. He notes a productive cough , a
subjective fever and nausea and vomiting at home. He was
subsequently seen in Electrophysiology Clinic. He had a low
grade fever of 100.0 at that time. He was electively admitted
but on the way to the floor , his ICD fired again. He was given
lidocaine and after a third firing of his ICD , he was begun on
amiodarone. The patient then became short of breath and was in
pulmonary edema , requiring intubation. Chest x-ray showed a
right upper lobe white out. The patient was taken to Cath for
possible ischemia contributing to his ventricular fibrillation.
He had a proximal 80% LAD lesion and a mid 70% LAD lesion which
were both stented with Seifer stents. He also had a 60% D1
lesion which was angioplastied to a residual 40% lesion. He also
had a 70% left circumflex lesion. After catheterization , the
patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. He was
continued on his amiodarone load. He had no further arrhythmias
during his ICU stay. He was extubated the following day and was
diuresed for congestive heart failure. He also began treatment
for both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
He was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 23</PHI> ,
2005.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , EF of 15% , status
post ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , diabetes , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , and
hypothyroidism.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Synthroid.
2. Lasix.
3. Coumadin.
4. Lopressor.
5. Lorazepam.
6. Colace.
7. Prilosec.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon transfer out of the Intensive Care
Unit , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 81 , blood pressure
108/74 , oxygen saturation of 84% on room air , and 97% on four
liters. JVP of 14 cm. Lungs with bibasilar rales. Cardiac exam
revealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft with a
pulsatile liver and mild right lower quadrant tenderness with no
rebound or guarding. His extremities had trace pitting edema.
Examination of his skin revealed vesicles at the sternum above
the nipple line with a papular rash extending in a dermatomal
pattern around to the right side of the back to the midline as
well as extension down the inner portion of his upper arm.
LABS: Labs were significant for a creatinine of 2.1 , and a
negative troponin on the day of admission.
IMPRESSION: 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy
admitted with ventricular fibrillation of unclear etiology ,
though possibilities include underlying infection or cardiac
ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was taken to the Cath Lab and
had stents placed in the LAD with other residual disease
remaining. The patient was continued on a regimen of aspirin ,
Plavix and a statin. The patient often refused to take the
statin , though this was recommended. He was also started on a
low dose of ace inhibitor which the patient frequently refused as
well. We would recommend starting a beta-blocker when the
patient is more stable. The patient continued to be diuresed
with Lasix until he was uvolemic and then resumed his home dose
of Lasix 80 mg daily. An echo during admission showed an EF of
15% with moderate aortic stenosis. For his episodes of
ventricular fibrillation , the patient was begun on an amiodarone
load with a goal of a total of 10 grams at which point he should
be tapered to 40 mg per day. He has one day remaining of his
amiodarone load and should begin the 400 mg per day dose on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 30</PHI> , 2005. He was monitored on telemetry without significant
event. The patient should follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Whitfield Unrein Sherwood</PHI> in
Electrophysiology Clinic.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for both
community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with
cefotaxime , azithromycin and Flagyl. The patient completed a
5-day course of azithromycin. He is still in the process of
completing a total 10 day course of cephalosporin and Flagyl. He
has one more day of therapy remaining. The patient was also
noted to have shingles. The patient reports experiencing pain
that started on his back before the rash appeared. The rash was
present prior to admission. He was started on acyclovir on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 23</PHI> , 2005 and this was stopped on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 26</PHI> , 2005 given that there
was likely little utility of treatment begun greater than 48
hours into the course and because the patient preferred not to
take the medication.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.5. Creatinine was initially elevated to
2.1 , but improved back to baseline prior to discharge.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , but was on
no medications as an outpatient. He received a diabetic diet and
was treated with a regular insulin sliding scale during
admission. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 , indicating poor glycemic
control. He was started on a low dose of glipizide and the
regular insulin sliding scale was discontinued. The patient also
has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH was checked and was 1.6 ,
which is within normal limits. The patient was also noted to
have a low calcium level and was found to be vitamin D deficient.
We have started supplementation of vitamin D.
5. Heme: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation
and low ejection fraction. The patient's Coumadin was initially
held but then restarted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 25</PHI> , 2005. He is now
therapeutic. Goal INR is 2-3. He will need to be monitored and
Coumadin adjusted as needed. The patient also has iron
deficiency anemia. He will need GI evaluation in the future. He
was begun on iron supplementation , however , the patient
frequently refuses to take this medication.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is therapeutic on Coumadin.
7. Code status: The patient is full code.
FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Blood draw in 2-3 days to monitor INR and creatinine. Please
adjust Coumadin dose for a goal INR of 2-3.
2. Taper amiodarone to 40 mg daily on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 30</PHI> , 2005 from the
loading dose of 400 mg t.i.d.
3. Please encourage the patient to take simvastatin , captopril
and iron supplements. The patient frequently refuses to take
these recommended medications.
4. Last day of antibiotics is <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 29</PHI> , 2005.
5. The patient will need GI evaluation for his iron deficiency
anemia.

This was a 52 year old female with severe and poorly controlled
diabetes mellitus and hypertension recently hospitalized for repair
of a diabetic foot ulcer. She was discharged to rehabilitation
postoperatively on Clindamycin and apparently did well at
rehabilitation. She was recently , this past week , discharged home

onset of nausea and vomiting two to three times a day and severe
constipation. There was no blood in her vomit , no sick contacts ,
no bowel movements for the past four or five days , no hematemesis ,
and no fever or chills. She was unable to keep down any p.o. She
also noted over the past week an increase in her chronic bilateral
arm pain and onset of new right scapular pain. Arm pain and hand
pain had been attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome in the past.
She reported chest pressure but denied shortness of breath ,
diaphoresis , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , and any other
chest pain syndrome. Patient also complained of right upper
quadrant epigastric abdominal tenderness. She had a history of an
open cholecystectomy in 1980. She did not drink alcohol and she
had had no other abdominal surgery. The pain was associated with
nausea and vomiting. She presented to the Emergency Ward and was
found to have a lipase of 529. She was evaluated for acute
pancreatitis. She received hydration in the Emergency Room and was
admitted to the general medical service for work-up.

liters saturating 98%. HEENT: Benign. NECK: Without thyroid
masses , supple , and no adenopathy. BACK: No costovertebral angle
tenderness and reproducible tenderness over right scapula. PULSES:
2+ throughout. NODES: No cervical , occipital , axillary , or
supraclavicular adenopathy. HEART: S1 , S2 , and no rubs , murmurs ,
or gallops. LUNGS: Bilateral basilar crackles , left greater than
right , otherwise clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Slightly
distended , mildly tympanitic , decreased bowel sounds but present ,
mild to moderate abdominal tenderness that was diffuse but
increased on palpation in the epigastric region , no fluid wave , and
no rebound. EXTREMITIES: Right ankle ulcer , dry. RECTAL: Guaiac
negative. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray showed mild increase in heart
size and no effusions or infiltrates. KUB
showed no evidence of obstruction and full of stool. EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm at 84 and downsloping ST segments inferiorly
and laterally that were not new. Laboratories showed a sodium of
115 , potassium 4.4 , bicarbonate of 14 , and arterial blood gas
showed pH of 7.48 , pCO2 of 36 , pO2 of 112 , lipase of 529 that on

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/05/2915</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 33 year-old woman
with diet controlled diabetes
mellitus , morbid obesity , who presents to the emergency department
with periumbilical pain , radiating to the right lower quadrant. In
her first trip to the emergency department her pain was diffuse and
was thought to be gastroenteritis. After being sent home , she had
an increase in pain and vomiting and was unable to tolerate p.o. On
her second trip one day later she was vomiting with no fever but
chills and no flatus. The decision was made to take her to the
operating room to explore for appendicitis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
diet controlled.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.
MEDICATION: None.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a morbidly obese woman in
no acute distress. She was tachycardic.
Chest was clear. Abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds ,
tenderness in the right and left lower quadrant with positive psoas
and Rovsing's sign. Rectal examination showed normal tone and no
stool. Pelvic examination showed no cervical motion tenderness.
LABORATORY: Abdominal CT was obtained which showed 5x5 cm cecal
thickening with extraluminal air. This was thought to be consistent with a
perforated appendicitis or phlegmon. CBC showed a white blood
count 19 , 000. Her urine HCG was negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">March 31</PHI> , by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">WNCUSZ</PHI> , who initially opened the
right lower quadrant to explore for appendicitis. In exploring the
abdomen , purulent material was found in the right lower quadrant ,
and the appendix was not able to be visualized. The decision was
made to open the midline incision which was done. Details of the
operation may be found in Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">WNCUSZ</PHI> 's operative report. By
report , she had gangrenous portions of the right colon ,
necessitating a right colectomy. This was performed , and she
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred extubated in
stable condition to the floor. Her immediate postoperative course
was complicated by supraventricular tachycardia to a rate of 200
with hypotension , requiring beta blockade and adenosine. She was
transferred to the Surgical ICU for further management. After the
use of beta blockade and adenosine , her arrhythmia resolved. This
was found to occur with magnesium of 1.5 which was repleted. Per
recommendations of the Cardiology Service , an echocardiogram was
obtained which was normal , and she ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial CKs and electrocardiograms. An NG tube was in
place which was continued on the first postoperative day , and she
was kept on Zantac. She was kept on ampicillin , levofloxacin and
Flagyl. A central line was in place. Over the next few
postoperative days , as her NG tube was removed and her diet slowly
advanced with sips , she was converted to p.o. medication. At one
point she developed a second episode of supraventricular
tachycardia and was thought to be either atrial fibrillation versus
sinus tachycardia. This did not respond immediately to Lopressor
and per Cardiology's recommendations , she was changed to diltiazem
followed by Diltiazem drip. When stabilized , her dose of Lopressor
was increased , Diltiazem stopped and she was converted to p.o.
Lopressor 50 t.i.d. which kept her in sinus rhythm and a stable
rate. By the third and fourth postoperative day , she was
tolerating a regular diet , passing flatus and bowel movements and
ambulating independently. She was weaned off her oxygen and her
central line was discontinued. She was stable for discharge.
The patient was discharged to home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 5</PHI> , 2000. At that time
she will have completed a 5-day course of ampicillin , levofloxacin
and Flagyl. She is tolerating a regular diet , ambulating
dependently and requiring minimal amounts of oral analgesics. She
received wet to dry dressing changes b.i.d. to her wounds , which
will need to be continued as an outpatient by a visiting nurse.
DISCHARGE MEDICATION: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet 1-2
tabs p.o. q 3-4 hours p.r.n. pain , Colace 100
mg b.i.d. while on Percocet.
FOLLOWUP: The patient is instructed to followup with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">WNCUSZ</PHI>
in 1-2 weeks and should call his office for an
appointment.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old male with endstage renal
disease , on hemodialysis and prior peptic
ulcer disease , who underwent EGD and colonoscopy four days prior to
arrival for evaluation of guaiac-positive stool. He underwent
polypectomy at that time without complication , but on the day of
admission noted bright red blood per rectum. Additionally he felt weak and
lightheaded and presented to the ED where his initial vital signs showed a

127/64 , O2 saturation 100% on 2 liters , breathing 12 times a
minute , alert and oriented x2 in no acute distress. Neck:
Supple neck with a thyroidectomy scar. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm
without murmur , rubs or gallops. JVP 9. AV fistula in the
bilateral upper and lower extremities with no thrill or bruit.
Abdomen: Obese , soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel
sounds. Neurologic: Slow , responsive , but appropriate , moving
all extremities , ambulatory. Digital rectal examination positive
for blood.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 ,
BUN of 79 , creatinine of 10.3 , lactic acid 1.5 , WBCs of 5 ,
hematocrit of 28.7 , platelets of 162.
PROCEDURES: Colonoscopy with embolization of the ileocecal
artery on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06/2921</PHI> , repeat colonoscopy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/10/2921.</PHI>
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
GI: The patient was admitted to the MICU following presentation
to the emergency room with bright red blood per rectum and a
hematocrit of 28. Over the first couple of days in intensive
care , he received 8 to 9 units of packed red blood cells and On hospital day
#2 , he underwent an embolization of the ileocecal artery with subsequent
improvement in clinical picture. Over the next couple of days , he continued to
have
guaiac-positive and melena stools but with stabilization in his
hematocrit. A repeat colonoscopy was completed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/10/2921</PHI> ,
which showed a single white ulcer in the colon thought to be the
old polypectomy site but no signs of new or old blood.
Throughout the rest of his hospitalization , his hematocrit
remained stable and he was maintained on PPIs twice a day.
Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis three times a week. This was continued during his
hospitalization. He has had recurrent issues with AV fistula
failure. On admission , he was relying on the left lower
extremity shunt. There was a hardened area proximal to the shunt
found on physical exam and an absence of a thrill at
the site. Per Renal recommendation , this was evaluated
with an AV fistulogram and a subsequent ultrasound. The
ultrasound revealed that there was complex fluid collection
proximal to his AV graft. He was evaluated by Surgery who did
not feel further workup was indicated at this time. The patient
will be discharged to resume his routine renal regimen.
Psych: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and mild
mental retardation. We continued his outpatient psychiatric
medications. There were no acute issues.
Heme: The patient has a chronic anemia with a high MCV. Iron
studies suggest an anemia of chronic disease. He will be
discharged on his preadmission medications of B12 , folate and
iron once a day. His hematocrit has remained in the mid 30s.
Cardiovascular: There were no acute issues during his initial
hospitalization when he was hypotensive secondary to GI bleed.
His home beta-blocker was held. This was restarted prior to
discharge without incident. His Cardura was not restarted and
the patient did not become hypertensive. He will be discharged
without it. Additionally , we are holding his aspirin at
discharge until his followup primary care appointment.
Prophylaxis: pneumoboots; ambulation and
twice-a-day proton pump inhibitor.
FEN: Renal diet.
DISPOSITION: The patient was being discharged home. He was seen
and evaluated by Physical Therapy who felt that this would be a
safe disposition plan.
CODE: He was a full code.

Impression: demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoglycemia
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient had no recurrence of chest pain once she arrived on the
floor , or for that matter , SOB/N/V. She initally had difficulty
maintaining her blood sugars and was given another amp of d50 and
orange juice on the floor. After the first 12 hours , her blood sugars
have been consistently over 120. Although she was very enzyme posive
for NSTEMI ( MB 31.2--&gt;32.4--&gt;15.4 today ) , chest pain did not recur. IN
fact , her EKG has been normal since arriving on the floor. Therefore ,
her episode of ischemia was thought to be demand related ischemia in
the context of hypoglycemia. Causes of the hypoglycemia included hypoth
yroidism , adrenal insufficiency , and iatrogenesis. Given the finite
duration of the hypoglycemia , the latter possibility was deemed most
likely ( TSH , AM cortisol wnl ). The patient's cardiac enzymes have
peaked ( MB: 31.2--&gt;31.4--&gt; 15.4 ). The patient's home situation has been
previouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have been
dealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. This time , there was concern
over potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband or
medication errors. Social work was called and spoke with the daughter.
She appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother's health
and open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility at
some later date. It is clear that an elaborate and effective system has
been worked out to monitor and treat the patient's blood sugars. The
patients visiting nurse service ( <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">XEEWDN</PHI> ) was contacted to reemphasize
the importance of evaluating the patient's medication regimen. The
nurse involved in the patient's care also will initiate a request
for a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. Elder
services was informed to initiate a consult. The social worker at
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">House Villagomez</PHI> was also informed of this admission. The
patient's home situation is deemed safe for discharge. She will
follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Whitfield Unrein Sherwood</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 28th.</PHI> VNA will visit her
tommorrow. The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly the day of dischar
ge. However , the patient was guaiac negative. Parenthetically , the
patient had a slightly dirty UA on admission. She was initially treated
but given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was too
low. Your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call your
physician if they are consistently above 150. Your dose of lipitor has
been increased because your LDL on this admission was 92.

Hospital Course:
57 yo F with complex medical history here with mental status
change likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy with some component of
medication-induced delirium ( from opiates ).
++Mental Status - Avoided increasing narcotics. Given lactulose QID.
Mental status improved significantly in first 24 hours of
hospitalization. Patient then remained at her baseline mental status for
rest of hospital stay.
++MSK - Patient has history of chronic low back pain that is
likely related to bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures seen on MRI on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/14/21.</PHI> We avoided increasing her narcotic dose for concern of her
altered mental status. Pain was controlled effectively with MSIR prn ,
celecoxib daily prn ( should not increase to bid given ? increase risk of
cardiac side effects ) , and a lidoderm patch over her lower back. Other
NSAIDS were avoided given h/o GI bleed. Patient is scheduled to f/u with
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Alana , Yelvington Natalie</PHI> ( Rheumatology ) for management of her back pain and
consideration of sacroplasty. Patient should be seen by PT at her nursing
home to help her with her walking.
++GI/ID - Had low-grade fevers overnight on HD 1 and 2. Patient had mild
RUQ tenderness which raised a question of possible GI / biliary source of
infection. Blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph in 2/4
bottles. She was treated with Ciprofloxacin and
Metronidazol starting on HD 1 , and vancomycin until speciation of blood
cultures. Blood cultures repeated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/20</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/21</PHI>
were negative to date. Coag neg staph blood cultures were thought to be
due to contamination. Patient has remained afebrile and abdominal
tenderness has resolved over hospital stay. Vancomycin was discontinued
on HD 3 and Cipro and Flagyl were continued. She was discharged with
instructions to complete a 14-day course of Cipro and Flagyl. Her WBC
count and platelets decreased gradually throughout her hospital stay and
were 3.88 and 122 respectively. A CBC should be checked on Monday <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/24</PHI> to
make sure that she is not becoming neutropenic or thrombocytopenic.
++Pulm - The possibility of PE was considered given lower extremity
swelling and her change in mental status. Given that she was at her
baseline oxygen requirement and had negative LENIs , PE was thought to be
low probability. She remained at her baseline oxygen saturation ( 93-98%
on room air ) for the duration of her hospitalization. Given flovent for
known COPD.
++CV - EKG at admission was unchanged from previous EKGs. Patient's dose
of Lopressor was decreased , given her low BP at time of admission. Her
heart rate and blood pressure remained in the normal range throughout her
admission.
++Endo: MRI read from <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/14/21</PHI> showed evidence of osteoporosis. Started
caltrate , vit D. Unable to give fosamax because of history of esophageal
varices. Giving zometa x 1. Corrected calcium was normal. Will need to
re-check calcium in 1 week.
++FEN - Given thiamine , folate , fluids , Is/Os , weights.
++PPX - Lovenox , nexium , aspiration precautions.

home. Patient should have a CBC drawn on Monday <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/24</PHI> to check her white
count and platements , which were trending down slowly throughout her
admission and recheck calcium ( corrected for albumin ) in one week.

DIAGNOSIS: LEFT URETERAL STRICTURE.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: FLEXIBLE CYSTOSCOPY , LEFT EXTERNAL
URETERAL STENT PLACEMENT , REPAIR OF
LEFT DISTAL URETERAL STRICTURE
( BOARI FLAP ) BY DR. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Unsworth , G. Lenore</PHI>
ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-3-07.</PHI> INTERNALIZATION OF LEFT
STENT BY DR. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Unsworth , G. Lenore</PHI> ON
<PHI TYPE="DATE">4-14-07.</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61 year old female
who underwent a left ureteral
lithotomy in 1985. She subsequently developed a left ureteral
stricture at the pelvic brim , which was balloon dilated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-03.</PHI>
The patient received 2-1/2 years of relief , but the presented with
left flank pain and left hydronephrosis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-06.</PHI> She had relief
with a left percutaneous nephrostomy , and later another balloon
dilatation. She had a third balloon dilatation in <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-07</PHI> , and this
was of a 4-centimeter segment. A stent was left in place. The
stent presently is within the ureter. The patient now presents for
the above-mentioned procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as above.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY was as above , plus thyroid cyst excision ,
liposuction of bilateral lower extremities , cholecystectomy ,
appendectomy , vein stripping , carpal tunnel release bilaterally ,
and tubal ligation. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Levothyroxine
0.025 milligrams 2 tablets per day , Motrin as needed , Tylenol as
needed , Percocet as needed. ALLERGIES included penicillin which
caused a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese female in no acute
distress. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat
examination was clear. Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Back has no costovertebral angle tenderness. Lungs were clear.
Heart had regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen was obese , soft ,
nondistended , nontender , good bowel sounds , multiple surgical scars
along the abdomen which were well-healed. Rectal examination
showed increased tone , tender secondary to hemorrhoid. Neurologic
examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , hematocrit was 29.7 ,
prothrombin time 11.8 , partial
thromboplastin time 21.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-2-07</PHI> , for a
procedure on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-3-07.</PHI> She underwent the
above-mentioned procedure without difficulty. The patient did lose
1 liter of blood , however , and received 2 units of autologous
packed red blood cells as well as 4 , 000 cc of lactated Ringer's and
2 , 000 cc of Hespan and 500 cc of albumin. In the operating room ,
they found the left distal ureteral stricture , approximately 8
centimeters with a small stone cluster. The patient left the
operating room in stable condition with a Foley to gravity , a
7-French single pigtail external ureteral stent , as well as a
Jackson-Pratt drain to suction. Postoperatively , the patient did
well. She did have a low hematocrit in the immediate postoperative
period requiring 2 units of blood. Her level was 21.9. Otherwise ,
electrolytes were stable and the patient was doing well. The
patient was taken to the ward for the remainder of her
postoperative care. We kept her on intravenous antibiotics and
nothing-per-oral until she passed flatus , at which point she was
able to tolerate a diet. Because of the duration of surgery , as
well as her large size , pulmonary toilet was encouraged with the
patient. On postoperative day #3 , the patient persisted with a
fever of unknown origin , again thought to be respiratory as
mentioned above. Cultures were taken and she remained on
antibiotics. Stentogram was done on postoperative day #10. This
showed extravasation of fluid distally in the ureter. Cystogram
showed no bladder extravasation. With that in mind , the Foley was
taken out and the stent was left in place. It was anticipated that
she would be taken back another time for stent removal. The
patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-16-07.</PHI> The external stent had actually
been switched over to an internal stent at the time of discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. CONDITION ON
DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP
with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Unger G. Lorna</PHI> , and will call the genitourinary staff
or come to the emergency room for fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting
or other questions or concerns. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were
Percocet and Keflex.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/1/2922</PHI>
ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Isaacson , Sasha Ullman</PHI> M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hip fracture.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post hip surgery and end-stage renal
disease.
Please see original dictation for the history of present illness ,
past medical history , medications on admission , allergies , social
history , the family history , physical exam on admission , EKG on
admission and all data. Please also see that for the initial
hospital course this dictation only goes from <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 04/25/07</PHI>
through <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/1/22.</PHI>
1. Orthopedics. There is no update on his orthopedics course.
He needs to continue his heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice
daily for one month following his surgery , which was <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/31/22</PHI> , so
he just about to complete this one month course. He should be on
Ultram 50 mg every twelve hours as needed for pain. All
narcotics should be avoided as these results in severe delirium
for Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Isaacs.</PHI>
No update to cardiovascular ischemia.
Cardiovascular rhythm. His Lopressor continued to be held for
the remainder of his hospitalization. His blood pressure was
within normal limits between 100-110/60-70 and his heart rate
remained in the 60s-70s , no higher than the 80s. If his blood
pressure increases , starting Lopressor again at 25 mg twice daily
would be wise , however , currently his blood pressure is not high
nor does his rate require this.
There is no uptake to his renal course. He continued on his
dialysis on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturdays. However , he also
got dialysis on Friday the <PHI TYPE="DATE">31st</PHI> since he is being discharged
today , so that he can be changed to a Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday dialysis course at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Zwilling Wendie Gayle Carly.</PHI>
From an endocrine perspective , he remained on sliding scale
insulin only. He did not need to be restarted on his Lantus.
There is no further update to his GI oncologic history. He
should continue to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HUWDHZ</PHI> on in <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/15/22</PHI> at
3:00 p.m.
From a delirium perspective , his Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime was
discontinued after his sense of delirium has been cleared for
multiple days. However , if he were to start to have any sorts of
hallucinations or issues with confusion , we would restart the
Zyprexa immediately 2.5 mg at bedtime +2.5 mg as needed. The
patient is currently stable again off Zyprexa , but it has only
been discontinued for two days , so he may well need this to be
added on. As soon as the Zyprexa is added on , he has cleared his
delirium pretty quickly , so this has been quite effective for
him.
From an ID perspective. He was continued on his rifampin 300 mg
twice daily as well as his penicillin 2 million units every four
hours and these antibiotics should be continued through <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/31/22.</PHI>
He has an appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">WNIWU</PHI> in the ID Clinic on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/29/22</PHI> at 8:00 a.m. to follow up on these issues. Please make
sure that the patient attends this appointment as it is very
important in terms of deceptive time running any changes in his
antibiotic course. He completed his course of Valtrex and does
not need any further treatment with Valtrex.
Gout. The patient developed gout in his right MCP and PIP joints
several days prior to discharge. He was restarted on his
colchicine every other day. He was also started on a higher dose
of prednisone of 20 mg daily. This should be continued for five
additional days and then he can be decreased back down to 10 mg
for several days and then down to his baseline dose of 5 mg
daily. He should continue on 5 mg of prednisone daily for the
foreseeable future.
From an FEN perspective , Nutrition was following the patient and
they recommended that he has his phosphorous checked regularly
and that he have assistance with his meals as much as possible so
that he can eat as much as possible.
From a hyponatremia perspective , his sodium was improved at the
time of this dictation and in fact on discharge , his sodium was
132. He should continue on free water restriction at the
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Zwilling Wendie Gayle Carly.</PHI> as his hyponatremia is likely from
hypervolemic hyponatremia given his low albumin and poor oncotic
pressure.
Code status , the patient will continue to be full code at the
time of this discharge addendum.
TO DO: Please make sure the patient continues with his
antibiotics through <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/31/22</PHI> also make sure that he sees <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ivie Wendy</PHI> in the ID Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/29/22</PHI> at 8 a.m. Please also make
sure that he sees Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Queen Holly</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oralee-Peggy Hassan Mann Elbert Otelia-Pacheco</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/15/22</PHI> at 3 p.m. as well as Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ocasio Osborne</PHI> on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">06/29/22</PHI> 11:30 a.m. He should also follow up with his primary
care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">NWDWD</PHI> following discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Zwilling Wendie Gayle Carly.</PHI>
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
2. Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily.
3. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d. , which should be
continued through the time of his discharge from rehabilitation.
4. NovoLog insulin as per sliding scale premeals.
5. Synthroid 75 mcg by mouth daily.
6. Nephrocaps 1 tab by mouth daily.
7. Zyprexa 2.5 mg by mouth every twelve hours as needed for
agitation or delirium.
8. Omeprazole 20 mg by mouth three times daily.
9. Penicillin G 2 million units IV every 4 hours.
10. Prednisone 20 mg every 24 hours for five doses , and then 10
mg every 24 hours for five doses , and then 5 mg every 24 hours
permanently.
11. Rifampin 300 mg by mouth twice daily.
12. Senna 2 tabs by mouth twice daily.
13. Flomax 0.8 mg by mouth daily.
14. Ultram 50 mg by mouth every twelve hours as needed for pain.
15. Effexor extended release 150 mg by mouth after dialysis.
16. ConvaTec Aquacel silver one topical daily.
Please remember to avoid narcotics and benzodiazepines in this
patient as he is very sensitive to medicines and may well
developed repeat delirium as has given them.

revealed: Cr of 10 , bicarb 6 , k 6.8. Pt then sent to ED.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
RENAL: Pt admitted with acute on chronic failure. The etiology was
unclear. His FK level was 4.8 , his UA was normal , urine eos were
negative. His low bicarb was due to his underlying renal failure , and

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/20/2917</PHI>
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 75-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease
status post five catheterization with a pacemaker in place ,
arthritis , gout , benign prostatic hypertrophy , hypertension and
myelodysplasia who presents with a history of lower
gastrointestinal bleeds. He has had three episodes in the past.
He presented to an outside hospital four days prior to admission
with symptoms of bright red blood per rectum. His vital signs at
that time were normal and stable with a hematocrit of 33. A tagged
red blood cell scan was negative during that hospitalization as was
an upper endoscopy. Colonoscopy revealed diverticula throughout
the large colon with more on the right than on the left. During
that hospitalization at the outside hospital , he was transfused
with four units of packed red blood cells and then transferred to
the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further evaluation and
treatment.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , his hematocrit was 32.9.
Subsequent serial hematocrits over the following
two days were stable. During the first hospital day , he had two
grossly heme-positive bowel movements and , by the second hospital
day , he had bowel movements that were brown and formed but guaiac
positive still. His hematocrit remained stable between 30 and 35
throughout his earlier hospitalization.
Given the patient's history of multiple gastrointestinal bleeds ,
the decision was made to perform a right hemicolectomy to prevent
further episodes. This was performed on hospital day number three.
See Operative Note for details.
The procedure and recovery were unremarkable. He was started on
sips on postoperative day number one and clear liquids on
postoperative day number two. He tolerated all of this well. His
Foley catheter was removed on postoperative day number two. His
diet was advanced. On postoperative day number three , he had
passed flatus. He began to have loose bowel movements. His diet
was advanced and , by postoperative day number four , he was
tolerating a regular house diet.
On the day of discharge , the patient was stable and tolerating
p.o.'s quite well. His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain
medication of Percocet and he was voiding freely without
difficulty. He was ambulating successfully. Therefore , it was
deemed that he was suitable for discharge.
The patient was seen by his cardiologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ingram.</PHI> throughout his
hospitalization. Prior to surgery , he was deemed suitable for
surgery without any serious cardiac risks. On postoperative day
#2 , the patient was noted to have a run of V-tach 10 beats ,
asymptomatic , no chest pain or discomfort , no shortness of breath.
He said that he was coughing at the time that that tracing came up.
A CK and troponin were sent which were both flat. The patient had
previously been ruled out for MI. Postoperatively , as a
prophylactic course , given that he has a ventricular pacemaker and
we could not follow EKGs based on that. The patient did well
thereafter , and had no further cardiac symptoms or issues. The
patient was seen by physical therapy throughout his postoperative
course and prior to discharge was deemed suitable for discharge to
home , was able to do all necessary activities to go home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol
25 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
p.r.n. constipation , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain ,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Flomax 0.8 mg p.o. q.d.
He will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">CWDOMD</PHI> , his hematologist , in 2-4 weeks.
He will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yanira , Stacey</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/24/17.</PHI> He was stable at
the time of discharge and is discharged to home with services.

*****
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 86F with hx CHF , Afib , CKD , and diabetes who
was admitted with partial SBO , bilateral aspiration pneumonia , and CHF
exacerbation.
-
GI: Admitted with partial SBO. She was treated wtih conservative
management. No NGT was required. The SBO resolved and she was passing
stool and tolerating a normal diet.
-
CV: She has a history of diastolic dysfunction. Echo <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/10</PHI> with EF 45-50% ,
no RWMA , mod LAE and RAE , bioprosthetic MV w/ tr MR , tr AR , severe TR ,
mild-mod PR. She reported SOB prior to admission which ws thought to be
due to a CHF exacerbation. She was not agressively diuresed in the
setting of the partial SBO. She is on variable doses of lasix
( 80-200mg po bid ) at home. She was initially given lasix 80mg bid which
required additional doses of lasix iv prn to diurese , so the dose was
increased to 160mg po bid. Repeat CXR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI> looks a little better than
admission. Overall her SOB and hypoxia improved. She no longer required
supplemental oxygen. She has a history of hypertension and was continued
on norvasc and imdur. She also has a history of Afib , now on coumadin.
Her rate was adequately controlled. The coumadin was initially held due
to possible procedures related to the SBO. The INR remained in 2-3 range ,
likely due to the antibiotics. The Coumadin was restarted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI> as the
INR was trending down , and was started at lower dose ( 2mg instead of 3mg )
given the antibiotics. Her INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as
an outpatient.
-
Pulmonary: She has a history of aspiration PNA. The Abd CT showed
bilateral lower lobe PNA , likely aspiration. She was treated with levo
and flagyl. Her WBC was elevated on admission and decreased during
hospitalization. She was afebrile. With treatment of the pneumonia and
CHF she was no longer hypoxic or SOB. She will continue levofloxacin and
flagyl for an 8-day course.
-
Renal: She has a history of CKD with Cr baseline of 2.6-2.8. Her Cr was
2.6 on admission and 2.3 on discharge. She continued home sevelamer.
-
Diabetes: Her insulin was initially held on admission due to NPO for the
SBO. When her SBO resolved and she was eating again , her home regimen of
lantus 100 units daily , Novolog 5 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale
was restarted. Her fingersticks continued to be high , perhaps due to
pneumonia. The insulin was titrated up for better glucose control to
Lantus 12 units daily , Novolog 7 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale.
The daughter is a nurse and will monitor and adjust her insulin at home.
HbA1c 8.2.
-
ID: Treatment for aspiration pneumonia as above with levofloxacin and
flagyl. Ucx with mixed flora.
-
Heme: Hct at baseline. As above , her INR remained high off coumadin ,
likely due to the antibiotics. Coumadin restarted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI> at a lower
dose. INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient
-
Nutrition: She had a radiologic swallowing evaluation which showed deep
laryngeal penetration with thin and nectar-thick liquid with no
aspiration and a tiny Zenker diverticulum. Diet recommendations were
ground diet ( for lack of teech ) and thin liquids.
-
Disposition: PT recommended rehab. Patient and daughter prefer patient to
go home w/ services. The daughter is a nurse. New PCP is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">ZWQSN</PHI>
( geriatrics ) at <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/2</PHI> at 2pm at
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Patterson Ivette</PHI> .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Pneumonia: She will be discharged on levofloxacin and flagyl to treat
her pneumonia to complete an 8-day course , which will end on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5.</PHI>
2. CHF: She will continue to take the lasix.
3. Hypertension: She should continue to take her previous medications.
4. Diabetes: Her insulin has been increased during hospitalization.
Continue to monitor the glucose levels and adjusting her insulin.
5. Coumadin: Her coumadin was restarted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI> at 2pm ( lower dose than
prior due to the effect of antibiotics increasing the INR ). However , her
INR has been low at 1.5 and 1.4 , so the coumadin has been increased to
3mg at discharge. Continue to monitor her INR and adjust her coumadin as
needed.
6. Continue home PT as recommended.
7. Seek medical attention if she develops fever , chills , shortness of
breath , chest pain , worsening cough , or any other concerning symptoms.

6-8/min with O2 desats to mid 80's on RA. Could be oversedation with
narcotics though she exhibited these episodes even when holding narcs ,
so more likely Pickwickian syndrome , will need a sleep study as
outpatient. She continues to complain of 8/10 pain even on her home
regimen of oxycontin/oxycodone , so we tried adding dilaudid and
morphin IR for breakthrough pain. Due to her apneic episodes and the
fact that she has not moved her bowels since admission we stopped these
and decreased her oxycontin by half to 10mg bid. Per pain service recs ,
we discontinued trazadone and added neurontin , as trazodone could be
contributing to her daily drowsiness , and neurontin may help with her
chronic pain. On discharge , we will not add any new narcotics. F/u pain
service as outpt.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
71 y/o woman w/ hx of GERD , ?anginal pain , DM , HTN , asthma , DJD ,
gastroparesis admitted with two episodes of chest pain on the night PTA
relieved by nitroglycerin. Chest pain was burning , substernal and
resolved 5 minutes after taking NTG. No EKG changes in the ED. Has
had past admissions for chest pain but unable to decipher GI vs.
cardiac origin. Negative dobutamine echo in '98; no CAD as of '89
catheterization. Has an atrophic left kidney.
Meds: asa , cozaar , lisinopril , lovastatin , isordil , lasix , nexium ,
neurontin , prozac , verapamil , atrovent , vioxx , insulin
Soc Hx: lives with grandson; quit tobacco in 2003; no alcohol
EKG: NSR , TWF V4-V6; LAE
***************************************
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
Her nexium dose was increased and she was initiated on reglan. Although
she initially agreed to an ETT-MIBI ( refused dobutamine , avoiding
adenosine/persantine due to COPD/asthma ) , on the day of the procedure
she refused saying "there is nothing wrong with my heart". A similar
refusal occurred on a past admission. She is to be discharged w/ f/u
with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vernie.</PHI>
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have any more chest pain please take a nitroglycerin. If the
pain does not go away call an ambulance. You may have heart disease
causing chest pain and so you will benefit from a stress test. Please
discuss with your doctor about scheduling this. Continue to take your
home medications. We have changed the dosing on the nexium and we have
added Reglan to help move food along.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1 )ATHEROSCLEROTIC OCCLUSIVE CORONARY ARTERY
DISEASE.
2 )PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
3 )GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE.
PROCEDURES: 1 )Cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-3-05.</PHI> 2 )Reop coronary
artery bypass grafting times three by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTCD</PHI> on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3-4-05.</PHI> 3 )Intra-aortic balloon placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-4-05.</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 69-year-old
gentleman who has hypertension , known
diabetes mellitus , and coronary artery disease. He underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1970 and a follow-up
catheterization in 1971 revealed all but one occluded saphenous
vein graft. He presents now because of accelerating angina.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-3-05.</PHI>
The cath revealed all grafts were occluded and he
had a 99% left main with severe three vessel disease. Because of
the patient's persistent chest pain with minimal exertion while in
the hospital he was taken urgently to surgery on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-4-05</PHI> where he
had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed prior to his surgery. At
the time of the procedure he underwent reop coronary artery bypass
grafting times three utilizing the saphenous vein graft from the
aorta to the LAD and aorta to D1 and aorta to OM 2. His postop
course was relatively uneventful. He remained hemodynamically
stable and his intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on the
first postop day. There were no problems discontinuing the IABP
and despite his peripheral vascular disease there was no problem
with the balloon pump. He continued to progress satisfactorily ,
was transferred to the Stepdown Unit , and was transferred to the
floor. He was placed back on his medication and he did have some
trouble swallowing postop but he had undergone an upper GI series
two weeks prior to his procedure which was read as normal. The
rest of his postop course was uneventful. His incisions healed
quite nicely and he was discharged on postop day six. His blood
sugar was controlled with CZI sliding scale while hospitalized. He
did have mild elevation in his BUN and creatinine to 32 and 1.6.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged with close follow-up to see Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Natalia</PHI> in the office in four days. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Included Cardizem 60 mg tid , Percocet prn pain ,
Digoxin .25 mg q daily , Trental 400 mg bid , and Ecotrin one q
daily. His discharge instructions include a regular diet , no heavy
lifting or driving for at least six weeks. FOLLOW-UP: With Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTCD</PHI> in approximately six weeks time. He will see Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Natalia</PHI> for
diabetic care as well as routine postoperative visit.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ASTHMA EXACERBATION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION
3. ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61 year old female
with the history of asthma , admitted
with increasing shortness of breath and chest congestion. She has
a history of asthma and has never been intubated. She has been
treated with steroid tapers in the past and hospitalized two times
before , most recently in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12-07.</PHI> Her usual asthma exacerbant is an
upper respiratory infection. She smoked until 5 days ago. She
complained of 3-4 days of chest congestion and runny nose. She
denies any productive cough , fever , sinus tenderness or GI
symptoms. She called her <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> physician and was put on Prednisone
for the past two days. She felt that her wheezing was increasing
and she came to the Emergency Ward. Her peak flow was 100. She
was treated with three nebulizers and her peak flow increased to
130. Her oxygen saturations is 95% on room air and no blood test
was done. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has the history of chest
burning when she doesn't take her medications or walks too much;
has had labile T-waves in the past with catheterization in 1989 ,
revealed clean coronary arteries. There is no change with food and
there is no acid taste associated with this burning pain. She has
the history of hypertension; degenerative joint disease; anxiety;
right lower quadrant pain , ultrasound in <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-07</PHI> , revealed fatty
liver , HIDA was negative; status post hysterectomy. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was on Atrovent
inhaler , Azmacort inhaler , aspirin one po q d , Verapamil SR 240 mg
po q am with 180 mg po q pm , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
po t.i.d. , Clinoril prn , Valium 5 mg po q.i.d. prn , Prednisone x 2

second floor apartment. She has three children and
several grandchildren. She is a retired nurse aid. She denies any
history of alcohol use. She smoked 1/2 pack per day until 5 days
ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission showed an obese black female in
no acute distress , able to speak without
difficulty. The blood pressure was 184/100 , pulse 80 , respiratory
rate 22 and temperature 97.8 with 96% saturations on 2 liters. The
oropharynx was clear with no erythema or exudate. The pupils
equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation; extraocular
movements were intact. The neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy , jugular venous distention or carotid bruits. The
cardiac was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , gallops or
rubs. The lungs showed prolonged expiratory phase with diminished
air movement and diffuse wheezing. The abdomen was soft , non
tender , normal bowel sounds. She did have mild right upper
quadrant tenderness but no liver edge was palpable; Murphy's
significant was negative. The extremities showed trace edema
bilaterally. The neurological examination was non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission was remarkable for normal SMA ,
normal CBC. The chest x-ray revealed no
infiltrate. The EKG was normal sinus rhythm with some mild T-wave
flattening.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with asthma
exacerbation. She was treated with
bronchodilator nebulizers around the clock and initially IV
steroids. On the following day , she had mildly decreased wheezing.
Her peak flow had increased to 200. She was changed to oral
steroids. She continued to improve slowly with slow improvement in
her peak flow. Her steroid taper was begun early given the past
history of paranoia with steroids. She felt that the Bactrim gave
her cramping and therefore this was discontinued as it was felt
highly unlikely that she had a bacterial infection and much more
likely that she had a viral upper respiratory infection disposing
her to her asthma exacerbation. She slowly continued to improve
and was discharged to home to complete a steroid taper. She had no
episodes of chest pain or other difficulties while in the hospital.

A/P:
82 yo RHM with h/o HTN , DM-2 , CAD and AVR ( on coumadin until <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/2920</PHI> )
was last seen normal when went to nap this afternoon at 12:45pm. At
2:30pm woke up dysarthric , mild RUE weakness. His wife noticed slowing
and confusion. Head CT at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Petronila:</PHI> ( repeated here ) showed small left BG bleed ,
extending to left lateral ( occipital horn ). Given location , most likely
hypertensive bleed. Cannot rule out underlying small stroke. Given h/o
AVR will r/o endocarditis as well. Plan
1. admit to NICU. When transfer to the floor <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CKIW</PHI>
2. BP control with home regimen. keep SBP&lt;140
3. Hold ASA. Continue holding coumadin , clarify indication in
the future
4. Hold metformin for now ( in case needs CT/A ) , add insulin
sliding scale
Brief Hospital Course:
The hemorrhage was stable on follow-up imaging. INR was 1.1.
Neurologic exam was stable , with persistent dysarthria , right pronator
drift , and mild right leg weakness. Patient evaluated by PT/OT and
deemed appropriate candidate for acute rehab.
Cardiovascular: Continued to be in atrial fibrillation. Pacemaker was
firing , but on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/21</PHI> pm had an episode of hr 30's x few seconds , and for
rest of night hr 40's - 50's. EKG unchanged from admission - atrial
fibrillation , left anterior fascicular block , some pvc's. Consulted
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CKIW</PHI> Cardiology , who analyzed the telemetry and found that bradycardic
readings were artifactual. There was no EKG obtained during bradycardia
and no documented physical exam findings to suggest bradycardia.
Cardiology felt there was no other evidence of pacer malfunction.

abnormalities. There was no significant pericardial effusion.
No vegetations were seen.
2. Transesophageal echocardiogram performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 12</PHI> , 2006
revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness with no
regional wall motion abnormalities , trace mitral regurgitation
was seen. There was no evidence of valvular vegetations or
abscesses.
3. A CT scan of the chest without contrast on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 6</PHI> , 2006 showed
a slight soft tissue prominence at the costosternal joint , but no
abscess and no bone destruction was seen. There was no drainable
fluid collection or bone destruction seen on the scan. MRI on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">May 12</PHI> , 2006 revealed a linear low signal within the sternum
suspicious for a fracture with adjacent rim-enhancing collection
extending both anterior and posterior to the sternum , suspicious
for an abscess. Hematoma is also possible.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient had a negative rule out
myocardial infarction protocol. She was maintained on her
antihypertensive medications during her hospitalization and she
was hemodynamically well controlled. Because the patient had
MRSA bacteremia upon admission and because the patient had
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a possible
diagnosis. TTE and TEE , however , showed no vegetations on the
patient's valves. The patient's CRP on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 10</PHI> , 2006 was 135 , the
patient's ESR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 5</PHI> , 2006 was 90.
2. Infectious disease: The patient had fevers upon admission to
greater than 101. Initial blood cultures revealed four of four
bottles to be MRSA bacteremia. Despite treatment with
vancomycin , the patient also had positive blood cultures on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 6</PHI> , 2006. At the time of this dictation , the patient had negative
blood cultures from <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 7</PHI> , 2006 through <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13</PHI> , 2006. She had a
bandemia to 6 on admission. It was not obvious initially what
the source was of the patient's MRSA bacteremia. Given her
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a
diagnosis. However , both TTE and TEE showed no evidence of
vegetations on the valves. The patient had a soft tissue
prominence on examination over her sternal manubrial joint on the
right side of her sternum. The original CT scan showed a soft
tissue prominence but no fluid collection. However , MRI on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 12</PHI> , 2006 showed evidence of an abscess or hematoma in the right
subpectoral region. The patient had a CT-guided aspiration
performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13th</PHI> , 2006 and 15 mL of pus was removed. The
drain was left in place. Studies from this fluid were pending at
the time of this dictation. However , the Thoracic Surgery
Service was consulted for possible debridement of the wound.
Infectious disease service was also consulted concerning the
timing for the placement of the PICC line , as well as the
duration of the patient's vancomycin.
3. Musculoskeletal: Chest x-ray showed evidence of an old left
shoulder fracture.
4. Rheumatology: The patient was maintained on prednisone for
dermatomyositis.
5. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on her home dose of
NPH. On this dose , the patient's blood sugars were well
controlled. The patient's TSH was measured A6 at 5.129 with a T4
of 7.2 and a THBR of 1.27. The patient's dose of Synthroid was
not altered.
6. Hematology: The patient was anemic on admission with
hematocrits ranging from 24-29. B12 level on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 5</PHI> , 2006 was
199. She was given supplementation , both orally and IM , and on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">May 14</PHI> , 2006 her B12 level was 842. She was also found to have
both iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Iron
studies from <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 7</PHI> , 2006 revealed an iron less than assay , a TIBC
of 202 , and ferritin 182. The patient was started on oral iron
supplementation during her hospitalization.
7. Skin: The patient was noted to have excoriations and open
lesions on her legs , which were likely due to itching. The
patient was given Bactroban. All of these excoriations were
clean , dry and intact. There was no evidence of infection.
9. Neurologic: The patient was maintained on amitriptyline and
Neurontin during her hospital stay.
10. Renal: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 14</PHI> , 2006 , the patient had a creatinine to
1.7. It is the feeling of the team that this is due to
gentamicin toxicity. At one point during the patient's
hospitalization , gentamicin had been added for synergistic effect
with vancomycin. Gentamicin had been added as the patient was
continuing to spike fevers despite vancomycin treatment. When
the patient's creatinine began to rise , gentamicin was
discontinued. Creatinine will likely resolve with time without
gentamicin administration in the future.
A component of the arf was due to repeated gadolidium exposure from repeat
mri of sternum and a hemodynamic with worsening when acei reinitiated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13</PHI> , 2006: In general , the patient is
fatigued and somnolent. At multiple times during the patient's
hospitalization , she became difficult to arouse. Upon touching
her sternum , however , the patient opened her eyes and was alert
and oriented. This seems to be her baseline behavior. There was
no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate
and rhythm , normal S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. The
patient had bilateral anterior chest wall pain to mild palpation
at the T3 level. Overlying the skin there was no erythema or
warmth. However , there was a fluctuant mass underneath the skin
surface. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally , but she had shallow respirations due to pain on deep
breaths. Her abdominal exam was soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed multiple excoriations that were
clean , dry , and intact. Although the patient was somnolent at
times and difficult to arouse , she was alert and oriented x3 and
her neurologic exam was nonfocal. It appears that the patient's
excessive tiredness and excessive sleeping is her baseline
behavior. When the patient needed to be awake and oriented to
perform certain tasks , such as getting an MRI , she was able to do
so. Moreover , when she was witnessed interacting with her son ,
she was more alert.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old female
with history of an inferior myocardial
infarction , coronary artery disease , and diverticulosis initially
admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/13/13</PHI> for conservative treatment of acute
diverticulitis. She was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/18/13.</PHI> The patient now
presents for elective sigmoid colectomy. The patient had had no
recent angina since her prior admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1998. According
to the patient she has rare , about one time every two weeks ,
episode of stable angina which presents as left arm pain relieved
by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient did not present with any
pattern of unstable angina. The patient denies recent fevers ,
chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , bright red blood per rectum ,
melena , cough , or pneumonia. The patient does report dyspnea on
exertion after climbing approximately one flight of stairs. The
patient has orthopnea as she sleeps with two pillows.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Status post myocardial infarction times two.
History of atrial fibrillation. History of
atrial flutter. Status post cardioversion times three in 1994.
History of hypertension. History of rheumatic heart disease.
History of congestive heart failure. Non-insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. History of two deep venous thromboses in 1970s.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Mitral valve commissurotomy. Mitral valve
repair with St. Jude's valve in 1981.
Appendectomy. Left hip fracture.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa , aspirin , Sotalol , as well as
Procainamide and Quinaglute.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg , Lopressor 180 mg t.i.d. , Glyburide 10 mg
b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg q.d. , Plaquenil 200 mg
b.i.d. , Isordil tempids 40 mg t.i.d. , and Coumadin 5 mg q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well developed , well nourished female in no
acute distress. Lungs clear to auscultation
without crackles. Heart: Mechanical S1 and normal S2. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , nondistended. Bowel sounds positive. 2+ edema to
calves bilaterally. Feet were warm and dry with normal capillary
refill.
LABORATORY DATA: ECG was significant for normal rate , atrial
fibrillation rhythm. No acute ST-T wave changes.
The patient had Q-waves in leads 3 and aVF. The patient's x-ray
was consistent with pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The cardiology service was consulted with the
recommendations that the patient be diuresed
aggressively , daily weights and ins-and-outs be followed , and fluid
and sodium restriction to patient. The patient was placed on
heparin preoperatively.
On hospital day #2 preoperatively , the patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit after she experienced a hypotensive
event with systolic blood pressure in the 50s with associated
drowsiness while maintaining her own airway. The feeling was that
the patient's event was likely secondary to the initiation of
Verapamil for rate control of her atrial fibrillation. The rate
control was then continued with Lopressor and Verapamil was held.
Goal potassium greater than 3.5 and magnesium greater than 2 were
maintained. The patient's diuresis was continued. The patient was
felt to be stable for surgery.
On hospital day #3 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/21/13</PHI> , the patient was brought to the
operating room for sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis , as
well as drainage of abscess. Postoperatively , the patient was
transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring of her cardiopulmonary issues. Postoperatively , the
patient progressed well. She was maintained on perioperative
Vancomycin , Levofloxacin , and Flagyl. Cardiovascularly , she was
maintained on Lopressor , Nitropaste , Hydralazine , and Digoxin for
her atrial flutter. The patient did well on the floor , tolerating
IV to p.o. pain control , reinstitution of Coumadin for
anticoagulation , tolerating regular activity. Of note ,
the patient completed a rule out for myocardial infarction by
serial enzymes and ECGs. The patient was seen by the physical
therapy service and noted to have progressively improving activity.
The patient was discharged in stable condition.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Chief Complaint: Left arm numbness and confusion
HPI: This is a 72 year old female with a history of DM and HTN who
was brought in by her family after transient sensation and confusion.
According to patient , while on her way back from her sleep apnea clinic
appointment , she felt a sudden pressure from her 'head down.' She had
been holding onto a strap on the bus with her left hand and suddenly
felt unable to hold on any longer and she felt tingling on her left arm.
While this was happening , she also became acutely confused and didn't
recognize her own neighborhood or even the house across from hers. She
was able to stand up and walk off of the bus as well as up five steps on
her front porch with assistance from the bus driver. By the time she
reached the front porch , 5 minutes after her symptoms started , she was
back to her normal self. At no time during this did she experience
headache , dizziness , vision/hearing changes , abnormal smell or nausea.
Her other extremities were not involved. She also never lost
consciousness.
ROS: positive for transient left arm tingling/numbness five times over
last three weeks but not associated with confusion.
General: Denies f/c/n/v , rash , diarrhea , BRBPR , abd pain , CP ,
palpitations , cough , SOB , DOE , change in bowel or bladder habits , joint
pain/swelling , weight gain/loss , sleep difficulties , headache.
Neurologic: Also denies abnormal gait , incontinence , or difficulty with
swallowing.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: chest pain and SOB
************************
HPI: 49 yo woman with h/o hyperlipidemia , HTN , DM , and spotty med
compliance presents with 2 months of exertional dyspnea and "burning"
chest discomfort which became acutely worse on day of admission while
walking four blocks. Symptoms improved w/ rest , worsened w/ activity.
Denied associated nausea/diaphoresis. When pt reclined in bed for the
night , sxs became acutely worse ( both SOB and burning ); these
improved immediately when she sat up. Typically uses 2 pillows at
night , denies PND. Has not taken lisinopril or lipitor in past week

Pain Control
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">GSDWXO</PHI> was admitted to the Orthopaedic Hand Service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/20/2921</PHI>
w/ a history of increased R shoulder pain following a cellulitis of
the right hand. An ESR was checked on admission and was slightly
elevated at 18. He was afebrile and non-toxic , therefore was not started
on antibiotics. Dilaudid was added to his pain regimen for his increased
discomfort.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/22/2921</PHI> a CT guided R shoulder joint fluid aspiration was performed
by Radiology. Analysis of this fluid was not consistant with joint
infection.
He received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis during his admission. On HD#4 he
was awake , alert , appropriate and afebrile with stable vitals signs. His
pain was well controlled on oral medications. He was discharged to home
and instructed to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenore.</PHI> at his previously scheduled
appointment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/7/2921.</PHI> His final joint fluid cultures were pending at
the time of discharge , he will be contacted at home if these turn
positivie.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Do pendulum range of motion exercises regularly. This is very
important in maintaining full range of motion. You should not add any
additional exercises until cleared to do so by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenore.</PHI>
2. You have been given a prescription for a narcotic for pain control. Do
not drive a motor vehicle , drink any alcohol or operate machinery while
taking this medication. As your pain allows , you should reduce the amount
of this medication accordingly. Narcotic pain medications can cause
constipation , so you should drink plenty of water and take a stool
softener ( Colace ) to help prevent this side effect.
3. Call Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenore.</PHI> at the number above , or your Primary Care Physician , or
go to a local emergency room if you develop fevers/chills , redness around
your incision that is warm to the touch , pus-like drainage from the
wound , loss of function ( either strength or sensation ) in your hand ,
return to your original symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath or any
other concerning symptoms.
4. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenore.</PHI>
5. Resume home medications unless specifically instructed otherwise.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: Anaphylaxis.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6. Diabetic retinopathy.
7. Urinary tract infection.
8. Adrenal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old female
with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica for which she takes
steroids and has developed adrenal insufficiency. She presented
to the emergency room with shortness of breath , wheezing , and a
maculopapular rash after receiving the pneumovax shot. She
received this shot upon discharge from admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valene Melba Conley;</PHI> for syncope and dehydration. The treatment there
was IV fluids in short course and increase in her steroids. In
the emergency room , she was treated with steroids , Benadryl , and
Pepcid.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Immunology: The patient was found to have anaphylactic
reaction to the Pneumovax shot that she received. Her
symptoms resolved by hospital day #1 after receiving IV Benadryl
around the clock , Pepcid , and an increased dose in her Hydrocort
to 100 mg IV q.6h. The steroids were started on a taper and on
the night of the first admission , the patient was noted to have increased
shortness of breath and
oxygen requirements. She was treated with oxygen and increased
steroids again for presumed reexacerbation of anaphylaxis.
2. Pulmonary: The episode of wheezing that she had on the first
day of admission could also be partly explained by fluid
overload. By hospital day #2 , she had developed crackles and
jugular venous distention. She has a history of diastolic heart
dysfunction , and diuresis was initiated. Despite receiving 3
doses of IV Lasix , she had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on the
second night of hospitalization. A chest x-ray was obtained at
that time which was consistent with pulmonary edema. She was
stabilized with additional Lasix and 100% nonrebreather mask , and
nitroglycerin. Her blood pressure was 200 systolic at that time.
The plan for continued diuresis was interrupted on hospital day
#3 when she became hypotensive and febrile with a UA consistent with infection.
She was started on Levo for presumed urosepsis.
On hospital day #4 , diuresis was resumed as her blood pressure
stabilized around 110 , and she still had a 5-6L oxygen requirement. The
patient reports her dry weight is 140 to 143 lbs. Her
primary care doctor suspects it more like 149 lbs. She is
currently receiving diuresis to wean oxygen requirement and is
down to 1 L per nasal cannula. Her goal fluid status is to
negative 1 L per day , and she continues to receive Lasix IV to
meet that goal.
She was also restarted on p.o. Lasix 30 mg p.o. daily. There
was some concern about aspiration by the nursing staff. She
immediately had trouble with swallowing liquids and Speech and
Swallow was consulted. The patient failed the bedside swallow
exam and so a video swallow was obtained , which actually showed
no evidence of aspiration , and so she was continued on a regular
diet. By the time of discharge she did not require any oxygen. She would
intermittently desat to the high 80s , which would quickly resolve with deep
breathing or chest PT.
3. Endocrinology. The patient has a history of PMR and adrenal
insufficiency , on 30 mg of Hydrocort daily at home. On the
<PHI TYPE="DATE">October 7</PHI> , 2005 , in the setting of urosepsis she was placed back on stress
dose steroids which was then tapered back to her home dose throughout the
rest of her hospitalization. She has a history of
diabetes type 2 requiring insulin inhouse or oral agents. Oral
agents were held and insulin was given for glucose control , NPH
30 units in the morning and 10 units in the evening seemed to
control the a.m. and p.m. sugars pretty well. Regular insulin
was added 6 units in the morning with breakfast with the morning
NPH for 1 p.m. blood sugar control , as this was the highest blood
sugar daily. Obviously , this needs to be monitored and adjusted
as needed as well the medicine staff is going to be following her
as to whether she should resume the oral agents. She does on
occasion drop her blood sugar to 50 or 60 , which is usually
asymptomatic.
4. Renal: Her baseline creatinine was 1.0. Both her BUN and
creatinine were elevated with diuresis. Her creatinine needs to
be monitored closely and medications need to renally dosed.
5. Infectious Disease: Her urine was positive for greater than
100 , 000 group B hemolytic Streptococci and she was initially
started with Levaquin. It was switched to penicillin on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 08</PHI> , 2005 , after the gram-positive organism was discovered and she
was switched back to Levaquin after the sensitivities came back ,
and it was sensitive to Levaquin. The Levaquin is ideal because
her coughing could also represent bronchitis. She has complained
of a cough since weeks before admission , which is now resolving.
6. Disposition: The patient does not feel that she can care for
herself at home and screening was placed to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Carl Grant Healthcare</PHI> , and that was accepted for the acute care center
for Saturday , <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 12</PHI> , 2005.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is just to follow up with
primary care physician. She should also follow up with Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hurley</PHI> from Pulmonary at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> An
appointment will be made for her. She should return to the
emergency room if she experiences chest pain , further shortness
of breath , severe sweating , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , or
other concerns.
LABORATORY DATA: On discharge , glucose 116 , BUN 30 , creatinine
1.3 , sodium 139 , potassium 3.4; please make a note that her
potassium requires repletion and should be monitored; chloride
93 , CO2 33 , CK 34 , calcium 8.7 , magnesium 1.8 , troponin less than
assay. White blood cell count is 7.04 , hemoglobin 10.6 ,
hematocrit 32.8 , and platelet 274 , 000. Urinalysis , greater than
100 , 000 with 4+ beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group B , sensitive
to penicillin and Cipro; with Cipro being a better choice , i.e. ,
levofloxacin because of her bronchitis.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
See radiologic data. Swallowing study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 10</PHI> , 2005 ,
showed normal video swallow. Portable chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 07</PHI> ,

PTCA.
3. UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
4. HYPOTENSION.
5. HISTORY OF ESOPHAGITIS.
6. HISTORY OF URINARY RETENTION SECONDARY TO
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old man with
a history of hypertension and pipe
smoking , who was admitted with a one month history of exertional
dizziness and diaphoresis. The patient had an ETT in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1992
where he went 6 minutes and 34 seconds on a standard Bruce to a
maximum heart rate of 145 and a maximum blood pressure of 170/90.
The patient stopped secondary to fatigue and did not have any chest
pain. The EKG showed 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in II , III and F and
V4-V6 , and was read as suggestive of coronary artery disease. The
patient was put on Atenolol 500 mg q.d. two weeks prior to
admission. The patient was also diagnosed with hypertension at
this time. One day prior to admission , the patient had three
episodes of exertional substernal chest tightness associated with
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and shortness of breath. Each
episode lasted 20-40 minutes and resolved with rest. The final
episode being on the day of admission at 9 A.M. There was no
nausea and vomiting. The patient denies paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and leg edema. The patient was treated in the Emergency
Room with Aspirin , Nitro Paste and oxygen , and sent to the floor
for further evaluation and treatment of his unstable angina. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes a history of a hiatal hernia , history of
recurrent esophagitis , with endoscopy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1991 which was
negative for Barrett's esophagus. The patient also had a history
of lower GI bleeding in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1991 , and a colonoscopy showed
diverticulosis. The patient had a history of urinary retention
secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. He also has a history
of urethral calculi and is status post an appendectomy. The
patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Include Atenolol 50 p.o. q.d. and Zantac 150 b.i.d. The patient is
a long time pipe smoker , and he denies alcohol use. FAMILY
HISTORY: Is notable for a father who died of a myocardial
infarction in 1962.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was a 63 year old male in no
acute distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
blood pressure 110/60 , pulse 64 , and respiratory rate of 18. His
pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light. The extraocular
movements were intact. His oropharynx was clear. He had no
jugular venous distention. He had 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. His lungs were clear. His heart was a regular rate and
rhythm , S1 and S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. His abdomen
was soft , nontender , with positive bowel sounds , and no
hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or
edema. His neurological exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam was
guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 107 ,
CO2 26 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose
148. The admission CK was 70. He had normal liver function tests.
His LDH was 144 , cholesterol 171 , triglycerides 257 , hematocrit
45.5 , platelets 198 , white blood count 7.42 with a normal
differential. PT 12.4 , PTT 27.4. His chest x-ray showed clear
lungs , and the EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 57 with an axis of
-4 degrees. There were T-waves in aVF , T-wave inversion in lead
III. There was no change from an EKG in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1992.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for rule
out myocardial infarction and treatment of his
unstable angina. On the floor , the patient experienced chest pain
and an EKG showed ST elevation in the inferior leads. As this
indicated that the patient was having an acute inferior myocardial
infarction , the patient was taken to an emergent catheterization as
PTCA was contraindicated because of his history of diverticulosis
with lower GI bleeding. At catheterization , the patient was noted
to have a 90% RCA lesion and a 90% LAD lesion. The RCA lesion was
successfully dilated , and the patient was admitted to the CCU for post
myocardial infarction care. His post MI course was complicated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/1/07</PHI> by
400 cc of coffeeground emesis. The patient's hematocrit fell from
40 to 35 , but was then stable. His Heparin and Aspirin were held ,
and the patient was given Omeprazole and antacids. The patient
also had an episode of left arm pain without any significant EKG
changes. As well , the patient experienced an episode of
hypotension with the blood pressure falling to the 70's following a
dose of Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The patient was treated with IV fluids
and was then stable. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/3/07</PHI> , an echocardiogram was notable for
left atrial size of 4.0 , inferior and posterior left ventricular moderate
hypokinesis but good overall LV systolic function. There
was 1+ TR , 1+ AI , and 1+ MR as well. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/3/07</PHI> , the patient was
transferred to the floor where he was noted to have a low grade
fever of 100.2. A subclavian catheter was removed and cultured ,
and several blood cultures were sent. The catheter tip culture
grew coagulase negative Staph but his blood cultures were negative.
This was felt to represent a contaminant and not requiring IV
treatment. The patient thereafter showed no signs of infection and
was afebrile. On the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/4/07</PHI> , the patient experienced
two episodes of sharp left sternal chest pain , one lasting five
minutes and the other three minutes , though unfortunately no EKG
was done at the time. The following day , the patient was
ambulating without chest pain. There were no further episodes of
chest pain. The patient was begun on low dose Inderal 5 mg t.i.d.
On the second , the patient had an ETT with a modified Bruce
protocol which was stopped at 8 minutes secondary to fatigue and
shortness of breath , and a maximum heart rate of 120 , and blood
pressure of 140/70. There were 1 mm ST depressions in leads I , L ,
anda V2-V6 which persisted during recovery. The patient was
presented with the option of remaining in the house with a repeat
catheterization with probable angioplasty of his LAD lesion the
following Monday ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/10/07</PHI> ) or recovering at home with readmissions
in one to two weeks for a repeat catheterization with
PTCA. The patient and his wife decided to opt for recovery at
home , and the patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/6/07.</PHI>

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: None.
OTHER TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES: None.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old male with
morbid obesity and history of multiple DVTs and pulmonary emboli ,
status post IVC filter placement who presented to the emergency
room with hemoptysis episode x1. He reported two tablespoons of
bright red blood when coughed up , but he did not have a
persistent cough. No shortness of breath. No fevers , chills ,
night sweats or other symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Morbid obesity , DVTs , PEs , hypertension ,
total hip replacement and status post hernia repair.
ALLERGIES: Versed.
EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97 , respirations 22 , blood
pressure 114/78 , oxygen 97 on room air. General: He is obese ,
talkative , walking around. Had moist mucous membranes. Unable
to assess JVP due to size. Lungs: Clear. Heart: Regular
without murmurs. S1 and S2 were normal. Abdomen: Obese ,
nontender , and nondistended and soft. Extremities: Show chronic
venostasis changes without evidence of cyanosis , open wound and
some edema was present. EKG on admission showed normal sinus
rhythm at 74 beats per minute with no significant ST-T changes.
Chest x-ray that he brought from an outside hospital showed right
hilar prominence with question of a mass. Chest x-ray in the
emergency room at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> showed no
acute process and severe pulmonary congestion.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 144 , potassium 4.1 ,
chloride 102 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose
104 , white blood cell 3.7 , hematocrit 54 , platelets 188 , INR 2.1 ,
PTT 33. An echo in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 2005 showed mild LVH and ejection
fraction of 55%-60% , increased RV , right systolic function mildly
reduced and mild RAE and LAE.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In the emergency room , the patient received
vitamin K 6 mg x1 to reverse his Coumadin in the setting of
hemoptysis.
1. Pulmonary: The source of his hemoptysis was initially
unclear. His sputum looked only blood tinged on the admission
exam , but the patient reported bright red blood prior to
admission. His chest x-ray from the outside hospital looked like
a right hilar prominence , which was read as a possible mass , but
a repeat study done in the emergency room at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vallejo , Voigt Mollie Izzo Woodrow</PHI> showed
only pulmonary congestion and no mass or acute process. He has
very minimal history of smoking cigarettes in the past. He was
too large to fit into a CAT scan machine , so he underwent a V/Q
scan , which demonstrated low probability for pulmonary embolus.
The pulmonary service was consulted and their impression was that
his hemoptysis was likely secondary to severe pulmonary
hypertension but not a mass or infection. They opted not to
perform a bronchoscopy and recommended starting sildenafil for
pulmonary hypertension. The <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanbuskirk Jack</PHI> , the Pulmonary
Hypertension Service was then consulted. They did not recommend
the sildenafil so that was actually not started. They did
recommend starting torsemide 80 b.i.d. for better diuresis and
this was initiated and resulted in good urine output. His home
dose of diuretic was 80 mg of Lasix daily. Upon discharge , he
was sent home on 80 mg of Lasix twice a day with recommendations
to have his blood drawn , to measure electrolytes within a week ,
and follow up with his PCP as soon as possible. The <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Verena Nigel</PHI>
recommended an outpatient cath and he was instructed to follow up
with them. He also reports a history of sleep apnea and BiPAP
use at home , although he admits that he does not use the BiPAP
machine. He was set up with BiPAP and nighttime oxygen inhouse
and he was continued on Coumadin for his history of pulmonary
emboli. His Coumadin was held initially on admission in the
setting of hemoptysis , but it was restarted after the V/Q scan
was low probability. He was also placed on a heparin drip while
the Coumadin was not therapeutic. He was discharged on 12 mg of
Coumadin daily.
2. Cardiovascular and hypertension: He was continued on his
home meds.
3. Infectious disease: He did develop bilateral lower extremity
erythema and tenderness on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24/20</PHI> and he was started on IV
Ancef 2 g q.8 h. for presumed cellulitis. This was changed to
Keflex upon discharge.
4. Gout: He continued on his home meds without incident.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have his
lytes drawn within a week by the PCP , VNA , or lab center. He was
instructed to have his INR measured on Monday or Tuesday and for
the results to be sent to his PCP and/or the Coumadin Clinic. He
was instructed to use oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula for 15
hours overnight and to use the BiPAP machine and elevate his legs
while not walking or standing and to wear compression stockings.
ALLERGIES: Midazolam.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENT: He has an appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Underdown , Ison Yeldell</PHI> ,

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease with myocardial
infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. CAD.
2. Hypertension.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Diabetes.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Peripheral vascular disease.
7. Smoking history.
8. History of alcohol abuse.
9. History of seizure disorder.
10. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">VWDDTD</PHI> is a 72-year-old man with
history of CAD status post CABG , PCI with history of stable
angina , type 2 diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , former
smoking history and also history of seizure disorder with
cataracts and recently discharged after an admission for atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He had occasional
anginal symptoms prior to discharge. He took about two
nitroglycerins per week. Over the past week , he had escalating
chest pain requiring one nitroglycerin per day. The pain was
relieved by rest and nitroglycerin. One week prior to admission ,
his digoxin was stopped and his amiodarone was decreased. His
Plavix was stopped and his Coumadin was held. On the morning of
admission , he had chest pain. He had two nitroglycerins and
rested but the pain persisted. He was taken to the ED. In the
ED , he received Lopressor , Enalapril , Lovenox treatment dose and
a Plavix load.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes CAD , hypertension , CHF , diabetes ,
hypercholesterolemia , peripheral vascular disease and past
smoking history.
ALLERGIES: To penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for past alcohol and smoking
history. He quit alcohol 25 years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Significant for afebrile , heart rate 45
and blood pressure 95/50. He had a left surgical pupil , left eye
ptosis at baseline. His heart had no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear. His abdomen was soft , nontender and
nondistended. He had bilateral femoral bruits , 2+ distal pulses.
No pronator drift.
LABS: Significant for hematocrit baseline at 30 to 32 , white
count of 13. His troponin peaked at 6.4.
EKG showed ST depressions in V3 through V6 that were new.
Echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/09/20</PHI> showed an EF of 25 to 30% with septal
akinesis lateral and posterior hypokinesis and mild tricuspid
regurgitation.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course for this 72-year-old man with
non-ST-elevation MI.
1. Cardiovascular: A catheterization on hospital day 1 showed
four-vessel disease. No intervention was taken at that point , as
it was unclear which region was the culprit. Afterwards , he was
in hypotensive respiratory distress , likely secondary to flash
pulmonary edema. He received Lasix and morphine and he was
started on a nitro drip with improvement in symptoms. He was
found to have flash pulmonary edema and in atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response. He was taken back to the
catheterization lab and given four stents to his saphenous vein
graft , OM1 with good resolution of his symptoms and he went to
the CCU afterwards. On hospital day 3 , he was transferred to the
floor and was given an amiodarone load given his ejection
fraction and increased ectopy on telemetry. His troponin had
been trended down to the 0.2s by discharge. His beta-blocker and
ACE inhibitor were titrated to heart rate and blood pressure.
Prior to anticipated discharge , he re-developed flash pulmonary
edema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Electrophysiology consult evaluated him and based on
his prior ejection fraction symptoms , it was decided to place a
dual-chamber pacemaker with AICD. He has had no respiratory
events since that placement. He has remained in atrial
fibrillation and was re-loaded with digoxin. He was started on
his Coumadin two days prior to discharge and was not yet
therapeutic. His repeat echo did show an EF of 55%. This was
after the pacemaker was placed.
2. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. He was given
Mucomyst precath with good effect. His creatinine on discharge
was 1.1 and he was making urine.
3. GU: He has had some symptoms of urinary retention with
difficult-to-place Foley. He was started on Flomax with good
effect. His prostate was not overtly large on exam. His PSA was
within normal limits.
4. Endocrine: He is a type 2 diabetic. His home dose of
metformin was held. He was continued on Lantus with sliding
scale insulin.
5. Hematology: His hematocrit was transiently down to 24. When
transferred out of the CCU , he was given three units of packed
red blood cells given his history of CAD. Since this , his
hematocrit has been stable in the 30-to-32 range. An abdominal
CT did not show any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. His groin
had only a very small hematoma. His stool guaiac was only trace
positive.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home in stable condition with VNA
services. He will follow up with his PCP on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/25/20</PHI> , with Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Salas Usha--Nannette.</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24/20</PHI> , and he should have his INR checked on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/23/20</PHI> or <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24/20</PHI> and Coumadin adjusted accordingly.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: His physical exam on
discharge was largely unchanged , afebrile and hemodynamically
stable. He had now a pacemaker placed over the left chest.
Incision looked clean , slightly tender to palpation. He had no
murmurs or rubs , no pedal edema. His chest was clear.

HOSPITAL COURSE: 68F w/ a hx of HTN , CRI , obesity , psoriasis presenting
w/ RLE ulcer and cellulitis. Hospital course complicated by episodes of
sinus brady to 30's w/ 4-6 sec pauses , asx , evaluated by EP , no need for
PPM at present.
**
1 ) R lower ext Ulcer and cellulitis - cellulitis initially treated with
nafcillin IV for 5 days with improvement in both swelling , erythema , and
pain. Discharge from the wound was cultured and grew out Ecoli and
Enterobacter , sensitive to cipro. Abx were switched to cipro which would
provide coverage for the gram negatives growing from her wound and also
cover her cellulitis. She will complete a total abx course of 12 days
( additional 5 days of cipro ). There was an initial concern for DVT but
LENIS were negative. Zinc and Vit C were added to her regimen. She will
also need Wound changes with NS wet to dry BID. The ulcer is most likely
due to poor wound healing in the setting of chronic venous stasis. It was
also noted that she had very weak LE pulse so vascualar surgery was
consulted. She was found to have + peripheral pulses by doppler , and
follow up with vascular surgery was set up for her. She will also get
umaboots and ABI at her followup.
***
2 ) bradycardia: to 30's during sleep. Pt came in on atenolol which we
discontinued , esecially in the setting of CRI. No tachyarrythmia on Tele.
Good HR response w/ actviity up to 70s. Evaluated by EP and felt that
she was not a candidate for a PPM at this point , especially since her
bradycardia is assymptomatic. It was felt that her bradycardia is most
likely due to her OSA , and that she would benefit from a sleep study. If
her bradycardia does not improve after treatment of her OSA , then she
will need to follow up with EP for further evaluation.
***
3 ) ENdo - fasting glucose normal , HGA1C -5.4.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/24/2913</PHI>
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest and epigastric pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
is having a significant amount of GI
distress with belching and gas over several months to years who
presents with three hours of upper abdominal and chest discomfort
which she described after a fall day of volunteering and doing her
exercise. Actually she was sitting down to eat and then developed
this symptom that lasted for about three hours. The patient did
not that she has run out of her Atenolol for more than three days
prior to admission and came to the Emergency Room when her pain did
not resolve after taking some Tums and some water. The patient
denies any previous history of angina. She came into the Emergency
Room and had a blood pressure of 190/97 with a normal EKG. The
patient was given 5 mg of Lopressor and started back on her
Atenolol with decrease of her heart rate and blood pressure and
resolution of her symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesteremia.
ALLERGIES: Streptomycin.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.
2. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg q d.
4. Niacin 250 mg b.i.d.
5. Colace.
6. Multivitamin.
7. NPH insulin 20 units q a.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a senior's home. She does
not smoke or drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: She was afebrile. Blood
pressure 150/90 , heart rate 84. O2
saturation was 94-97% on room air. GENERAL: The patient was a
pleasant obese woman in no acute distress , belching during her
history. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation except for
some initial left basilar crackles , which have cleared. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops or rubs.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. RECTAL: Heme negative , per
examination in the Emergency Room. EXTREMITIES: She did have some
bilateral trace edema. NEUROLOGIC: Non-focal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: SMA-7 was significant for a glucose 236. CPK
was 74 , troponin 0.04. CBC and coags were
normal. Chest x-ray did show a top normal cardiac silhouette with
mild evidence of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute
ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Short Stay Unit.
She was put on cardiac telemetry and was ruled
out for myocardial infarction with serial CPKs and EKGs. She had
no further episodes of her discomfort but did have continued
belching. On further discussion with the patient , she was actually
a relatively active woman who did not have any anginal symptoms in
the past and never described any shortness of breath , PND or
orthopnea. The plan was made to get an echocardiogram and do an
adenosine stress test. Her adenosine stress test was negative for
chest pain or EKG changes and her MIBI was negative for fixed
reversible defects. She therefore was felt to be negative for
ischemia. However , on her MIBI and her echocardiogram she did have
a mildly decreased LV function of 40-45% , of unknown significance
and unknown etiology. It was felt that this could be further
worked up for other causes , including sending out for TSH , SPEP ,
UPEP , and iron studies as an outpatient , as the patient was anxious
to leave the hospital. This could be done in clinic by her primary
care physician.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on her admission
medications with the addition of Axid 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and simethicone 80 q.i.d. p.r.n. for her gas. The patient
will discuss her GI symptoms with her primary care physician and
would benefit from further workup as an outpatient. The patient
was discharged in stable condition with no adverse drug reactions.
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nilsa Louis</PHI> in approximately
one to two weeks.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/26/2907</PHI>
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS IS CEREBRAL
PALSY WITH MENTAL RETARDATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 27 year old black man
with a history of cerebral palsy and
mental retardation who now presents with chest pain of three days
duration. His cardiac risk factors include positive family history
and a history of hypertension. He does not smoke tobacco and has
no history of diabetes. Note that the patient is a very poor
historian , however , through his mother , he complains of
approximately three weeks of increasing fatigue and malaise. The
week prior to admission , he had a single episode of chest pain at
"work" ( actually his day activity center ) which resolved
spontaneously. Three days prior to admission , the patient had
poorly defined chest pain with marked diaphoresis. This pain was
worse with deep inspiration and , in addition , he had generalized
nausea and malaise with shortness of breath. This pain waxed and
waned over the day and was not exertional in nature. He was seen
at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hyman Charles.</PHI> where no laboratories were drawn and he was
referred to follow-up on Friday. One day before admission , the
patient had chest pain radiating to the left upper arm with
numbness in that extremity. He had nausea and occasional
diaphoresis. He had an echocardiogram on that day at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hyman Charles.</PHI> which revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy but no
regional wall motion abnormality and was otherwise normal. On the
day of admission , the patient complained of increased severity of
chest pain with shortness of breath. He "felt sick" but denied
vomiting or diaphoresis. He came to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> Emergency Room where he continued to complain of chest
pain radiating to the left shoulder as well as into the abdomen.
This symptom was worsened with inspiration as well as with central
sternal palpation. At baseline , the patient does little exercise
secondary to his cerebral palsy , he has three-pillow orthopnea but
no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and he has no prior episodes of
chest pain except as described above. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for cerebral palsy as above and also for pneumonia in
1986. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes no medications. ALLERGIES:
He has no allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke tobacco ,
he does not drink alcohol , and he does not use intravenous drugs.
He is a regular church goer , he lives with his mother , and attends
a day rehabilitation care center. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for
angina in his mother and a grandfather with coronary artery
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was afebrile , his blood pressure was
160/130 , heart rate was 65 , respiratory rate
was 20 , and he was 98% saturated on room air. He was an obese
black man in no acute distress. SKIN: Clear. HEENT: The
oropharynx was clear , there was no jugular venous distention ,
carotids were 2+ and equal , pupils were equal , round , and reactive
to light and accommodation , and the neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy. The fundi were not well seen secondary to poor
cooperation. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: There was a
regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 were heard , and there was a
II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
ABDOMEN: Obese with positive bowel sounds , it was non-tender ,
slightly tympanitic , there was no hepatosplenomegaly , and the
patient was guaiac negative. EXTREMITIES: Examination revealed no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. There was no focal tenderness and
pulses were intact bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: He was alert and
oriented times three and he was unable to do simple calculations ,
however , cranial nerves II-XII were intact. Sensory and motor in
the upper and lower extremities were within normal limits , reflexes
were brisk and symmetric , and toes went down.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an
axis of 0 degrees and normal intravals.
There was left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in aVL and there
were no acute ST or T wave changes , however , there was no old EKG
for comparison. An SMA 7 was benign , a CK on admission was 283
with 10 MB , white count was 9.4 , and urinalysis was negative.
Chest X-Ray initially revealed evidence of pulmonary vascular
redistribution , however , a repeat chest X-Ray an hour later was
clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor and given
his rather indistinct complaints , a broad-based
work-up was initiated including a rule out for myocardial
infarction. Although the patient continued to have elevated CK
with elevated MB , these were electrophoresed and found not to be
MB. There was concern given the pleuritic nature of his chest pain
that the patient may have suffered a pulmonary embolism. Lower
extremity non-invasives were negative as was a VQ scan. The
patient was kept on cardiac monitor until his rule out for
myocardial infarction was complete. Throughout his
hospitalization , the patient continued to complain of diffuse body
pain as well as "feeling sick" , however , he continued to be
afebrile with normal laboratories. On the second hospital day , the
patient became aware of the fact that his mother had been admitted
to an outside hospital for a rule out myocardial infarction. He
became quite agitated and at that time complained of increasing
abdominal pain. He was treated with laxatives and reassurance and
seemed improved. On the fourth hospital day , it was felt that the
patient was not suffering from any serious illness and that the
most dangerous entities had been ruled out. It was felt that he
was most likely suffering from a viral flu syndrome. His blood
pressure was controlled with a beta blocker and he was discharged
in stable condition to home.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Nifedipine XL 30 mg p.o. q.d. , and Pepcid 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. He will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">OSZLMD</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> Clinic in one

Hemodynamically stable on Lopressor , now back in Afib , stable
rate of 90s , respiratory ventilated greater than 24 hours
postoperatively. Extubated on postoperative day 1 without
complication. Currently on 5 liters of O2 and some pulmonary
edema , improving with Lasix 20 mg IV t.i.d. and diuresis.
GI: Failed speech and swallow. Bedside Dobhoff placed. Started
on Osmolite tube feeds at 20 mL an hour. Awaiting nutrition
input for goals. Needs video swallow to assess swallow function.
Renal: Appropriately diuresing , maintaining 1.5 liters negative
until preop weight.
Endocrine: Stable on CVI. Hematology: Anticoagulation.
Coumadin and aspirin for atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues. Prophylactic antibiotics for chest tubes. In
step-down unit proceeded to progress well. Postop day 4 strict
n.p.o. per speech and swallow for aspiration with all
consistencies , currently on sitter. Postop day #5 , the patient
self discontinued the Dobbhoff feeding tube twice last night
requiring meds IV today until tube replaced and KUB confirmed tip
this afternoon. Dobbhoff currently okay to use. We will resume
tube feeds. Heart rate elevated to 90s-130s and also run of VT ,
which was asymptomatic. Rechecking electrolytes , BP stable.
Preop EF of 45%. Ordered echo to assess postop EF given run of
VT , which was 9 beats. Normal a.m. electrolytes. Remains on 3
liters of O2 , diuresing well. Speech and swallow will reassess
next week. Strict n.p.o. for history of aspiration. Afebrile.
White count improved to 10.9 , remains on sitter for mild
confusion. Plan rehabilitation when ready. Postop day 6 ,
chronic Afib , rate has been difficult to control , patient was on
Lopressor 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. postop via Dobbhoff tube. Patient
has self discontinued Dobbhoff several times and is quite
sensitive to missed dose of oral Lopressor so dosing IV Lopressor
currently. Heart rate is still a bit elevated at 100-120s , BP
stable. Mental status improved off sitter. Remains on 1.5
liters of O2 junky cough , unable to produce sputum. Afebrile.
White count stable at 10.4.
Chest x-ray looks okay. No echo ordered for her fellow. Repeat
electrolytes. Titrate beta-blocker. We will reorder echo if VT
recurs. PT consult placed. Postop day 7 , past video swallow
exempted. Dobbhoff out on sitter because he is having suicidal
ideations. He has been quite hyperglycemic with blood sugar in
350 range. EMS following. Screening for rehabilitation. Postop
day #8 , running a bit fast in Afib. Increase Lopressor. Mood
has improved. Will most likely be able to discontinue sitter
soon. Screen for rehabilitation. Postop day #9 in Afib running
between 90-100 , had been on a sitter up until this a.m. for
suicidal ideation a couple of days ago eating well. Screening
for rehab. Postop day 10 , rate controlled Afib/room air.
Patient followed by psych for postoperative confusion/possible
suicidal ideation. Patient stable on Celexa. Patient's UA from
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/06/21</PHI> with probable enterogram-negative rods. Started Cipro
x3 days. Continue rehabilitation screen. Postop day 11 , Afib ,
rate controlled/room air. Patient's chest x-ray with no edema ,
slight left middle lobe atelectasis. Neurologically stable and
Celexa ordered per psych. Awaiting rehabilitation bed. Postop
day 12 Afib/room air doing well with blood pressure. Seen by
psych and recommend follow up with them post DC for memory
studies. No new ??__??. Ready for rehabilitation. Just waiting
for acceptance and bed. Postop day 13 , rate controlled Afib/room
air. Patient waiting for rehab bed. On Coumadin for Afib ,
followed by psych for confusion/delirium and note by them that
they would like to follow up with him when he is discontinued.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Lightheadness , nausea
---
DDX: Hypertensive Urgency
---
HPI: 77 year old female with CAD s/p three stents , DM , HTN and CKD
was sent to ED by PCP after she presented to office with malaise ,
nausea and lightheadedness. Her symptoms first developed on
Thursday. She had checked her BS and BP at that time and they were
300 and 150 systolic. Her symptoms resolved but returned on Sunday
PTA and persisted throughout the day so Monday she went to
see her PCP. At the PCPs office her BP was noted to be 212 systolic
and she was sent to the ED for evaluation. Of note , on route to the
PCP office she had a fleeting episode of chest "cramping" which
was unlike her previous angina or MI pain. ---
In the ED: The patient received labetolol 10mg IV X2 , labetolol 400mg
po X1 , nitropaste 3". Her BP remained above 200 despite these
medications and then she received hydralazine 10mg IV X1 which
resulted in dropping her BP to 150 systolic.

---
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for management of
hypertensive urgency.
---
CV: The cause of her high BP is not clear. There is no indication of
med non-compliance. Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her.
Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor. She
was resumed on her home dose of Labetolol. There was discussion of
increasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary.
In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms of
feeling lightheaded. Therefore her hold parameters were increased to
130 systolic. In addition she had occasional ectopic apical heart
beats which resulted in early QRS complex and occasional
slight pauses &lt;2sec. No major events on telemetry. Her heart rate was
relatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. Her EKG did show
slight ( 1mm ) ST segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and her
CKMB was elevated on admission. She ruled out for MI with three sets
of neg troponins. She may have had slight demand ischemia in setting
of hypertension. Her CKMB was normal on day of discharge. Her troponins
were always negative. She had no s/s of CHF. She was monitored on
telemetry with no major events.
---
RENAL: The patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recent
history of contrast induced nephropathy. She had proteinuria on
admission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) but
her creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). A renal
ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. UPEP , SPEP
and spot urine/protein were ordered. Her spot urine protein was 222. Her
proteinuria in a chronic problem. UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up as
outpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low.
---
ENDO: The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home.
She missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent am
BS was high. She received NPH to cover her for the HD#1 and then
she resumed Lantus that evening. She also received her home humulog
and a sliding scale. She received a carb controlled diet. Her TSH was
1.2 on home Levoxyl.
---
FEN: Her lytes were repleted as needed.
---
GI: Her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and a
slightly distended CBD. Bili T and D were added and are normal. She had
no abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely to
represent a pathology.
---
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Monitor your BP at home and call your PCP if &gt;180.
2. Monitor Fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) and
record in a note book to bring to PCP appointment
3. Return to ED if you experience chest pain , shortness of breath ,
worsening nausea , extreme sweating , fainting , falling or other concerns
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up UPEP/SPEP. Follow Blood Pressures. Follow Fingersticks.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/27/2906</PHI>
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 59 year old white female
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post bypass in l988 who presented with atypical
chest pain consistent with unstable angina for rule out myocardial
infarction. Patient has multiple risk factors including a history
of inferior myocardial infarction , smoking history , family history ,
and age. She does not have diabetes mellitus or increased
cholesterol. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/03</PHI> , she had an inferior myocardial infarction
and had a catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l988 showing 70% left anterior
descending , 50% right circumflex , and l00% right coronary artery
lesion with an ejection fraction of 80%. In l988 , she had three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft with a LIMA to her left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to her OMB2 and right
coronary artery. The patient also has a history of peptic ulcer
disease diagnosed with melena in <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/03</PHI> and had an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral gastritis. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/03</PHI> , she
had a colonoscopy that showed diverticula and she has a history of
chronic anemia with a hematocrit in the mid to high twenties and an
MCV of 68. Patient was treated with H2 blockers and iron but
stopped secondary to constipation. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/05</PHI> , the patient again
presented with orthostatic changes and shortness of breath with
pain to her arm similar to her previous myocardial infarction pain.
Her hematocrit at that time was 20.8. She was transfused three
units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix and H2 blockers.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a catheterization
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/05</PHI> that showed patent LIMA to her left anterior descending ,
her left anterior descending native vessel was free of disease , and
a 50% long proximal circumflex lesion as well as a proximal OM2
lesion that was narrowed to 70% at its origin. An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy at that time was negative and the
patient was discharged home for colonoscopy with Small Bowel
Follow-Through that was never done. In the interval period prior
to admission , the patient was in her usual state of fair health
when she had an hour of chest pain in the morning and thirty
minutes in the evening per week. She also noted several episodes
at rest principally with increased anxiety and with confusion. The
patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CHCE</PHI> with a thirty minute history of
substernal chest pressure that was not responsive to sublingual
Nitroglycerin and was associated with diaphoresis and mild
shortness of breath. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for
coronary artery disease as described above , peptic ulcer disease as
above , left neck basal carcinoma in l986 , chronic iron deficiency
anemia , history of biliary colic and hiatal hernia , history of
chronic vertigo , and history of a thyroid nodule in the past.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her blood pressure was l22/90 ,
pulse of 90 , respiratory rate of l6 , and
temperature 98.2. HEENT: Unremarkable. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation. NECK: Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Showed non-displaced point of maximal intensity ,
regular rate and rhythm with a positive S4. There were no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. She had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits.
ABDOMEN: Showed active bowel sounds and was obese , soft , and
non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. EXTREMITIES:
Showed 2+ femoral , radial , and dorsalis pedis pulses without
bruits. She had no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. RECTAL: Showed
normal tone without masses and was guaiac negative. NEUROLOGICAL:
Grossly non-focal and within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , she had a hematocrit of 27.0 with
a white count of 6.9 and an MCV of 63.
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with axis of 20 degrees ,
intervals of 0.l6 , 0.08 , and 0.40 with a Q wave in III , and T wave
inversions in III , V3 , and Vl-V4. These were all unchanged from
her previous EKG from <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/05.</PHI>
HOSPITAL COURSE: Remarkable only for a rule out myocardial
infarction in which she had serial CK and EKG
that were completely within normal limits. Her CK were l54 , 482 ,
and 592 with normal MB fractions most consistent with either a very
small myocardial infarction or , more likely , CK leak from some
other source. Patient had several episodes of atypical chest pain
after being moved down to the floor and EKG were completely within
normal limits without any evidence of acute changes. Patient was
transferred to the floor on <PHI TYPE="DATE">l0/2l/9l</PHI> and her significant laboratory
data included a white blood cell count of 5.89 , hematocrit 34 ,
platelets 458 , and MCV of 68. Calcium was 9.4 , magnesium 2.6 ,
sodium l37 , potassium 4.6 , chloride l03 , bicarbonate 22 , BUN l8 ,
creatinine l.l , and glucose 9l. Serial CK were l54 , 482 , 592 , 553 ,
464 , and 3l2 , with MB fractions all less than l0. Her iron was l4
and her TIBC was 479 with a ferritin pending. Urinalysis showed
20-30 white blood cells with 3+ bacteria and a urine culture showed
greater than l00 , 000 E. coli. This was treated with Bactrim. On
<PHI TYPE="DATE">l0/22/9l</PHI> , the patient had no more episodes of chest pain and had an
exercise stress test on which he went nine minutes on a modified
Bruce protocol stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak heart rate
was 95 , blood pressure l75/75 without chest pain , and only unifocal
premature ventricular contractions with her exercise. She had
non-specific ST and T wave changes only without evidence for
ischemia. This was thought to be inconsistent with ongoing
ischemia and the patient was discharged to home. Of note , the
patient is not an <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CHCE</PHI> patient and has no primary doctor.
Therefore , I am going to assume her care as an out-patient in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> .
Pending laboratory data includes ferritin level.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Exercise tolerance test as above and
blood products received were none.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , ECASA , 80 mg
p.o. q.d. 2 ) Bactrim one tablet double-strength
p.o. b.i.d. times seven days. 3 ) Sublingual Nitroglycerin one q.5
minutes with chest pain as directed. 4 ) Metoprolol 75 mg p.o.
t.i.d. 5 ) Iron Sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) Pepcid 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. The patient will be followed in my clinic in the next
available and I have scheduled her for an Upper Series With Small
Bowel Follow-Through to follow-up on her gastrointestinal bleeding.
I started her on Iron Sulfate and have encouraged her to make sure
that she takes this in order to increase her hematocrit.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST CORONARY
ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT , URINARY TRACT INFECTION ,
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED , AND IRON DEFICIENCY
ANEMIA.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: "Feeling sick"
HPI: History was obtained from patient , who is a poor historian. He is
an 83 yo man with a history of CAD s/p MI in 1973 , s/p CABG x3 , T2DM ,
hypertension who presents "feeling sick" since last night. He states
that he took a Percocet for back pain and that after that he began to
feel numb in his arms and legs and around his head. He also had some
chest pressure. He took some SL nitro and doesn't remember if it helped.
Says it also wasn't relieved by positional change or rest. He denies
shortness of breath. He was having some nausea but no vomiting. He does
have some blurry vision at baseline , unchanged. He awoke this morning
and took his blood pressure. When he found his systolic was 190 , he
called EMS. He said he felt dizzy , "like I have pressure in my head , "
and could not describe it beyond that. He states that when his BP is
elevated his head feels like this and he gets flushed in the face.-----

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Non Q-wave myocardial infarction.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 60-year-old woman who was
admitted for chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a history of diabetes
mellitus , cerebrovascular accident in
1994 , gastroesophageal reflux disease , recurrent transient ischemic
attack , who was in her usual state of health until the day prior to
admission when she developed chest burning 3 days ago. The
symptoms were associated with nausea. She tried Maalox and H2
blocker without relief. The patient had stuttering symptoms off
and on throughout the day and night without relief. She was
brought in to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CKIW</PHI> today , given aspirin , sublingual Nitroglycerin
and transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for further
evaluation. In the Emergency Room , her systolic blood pressure is
130. She was tachycardic , and she was given IV Nitroglycerin. The
patient then became hypotensive due to overaggressive
Nitroglycerin. The patient received Inderal for tachycardia. No
tirofiban was given given her history of cerebrovascular accident.
Her chest burning was not resolved with IV Nitroglycerin. She was
given Morphine sulfate x 2 mg , Inderal and an esmolol drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypothyroidism. 2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypertension. 4. Borderline personality
disorder. 5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 6. Parathyroid
adenoma. 6. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy. 7. History
of migraine headache. 8. Chronic re-elevated liver function tests.
MEDICATIONS: 1. Atenolol 50 mg PO b.i.d. 2. Insulin 70/30.
3. Regular insulin. 4. NPH. 5. Metformin. 6.
Valium. 7. Aspirin. 8. Synthroid.
ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN , NOVOCAINE , ALDACTONE which all give hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother with CVA at age 21.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a schoolteacher. No alcohol or tobacco
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 132/84. Heart rate 94.
O2 saturation 93% on 2 liters. Sclerae were
anicteric. The lungs were clear. Heart was tachycardic , regular
with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen was with slight
hepatomegaly. Normal bowel sounds with slight right upper quadrant
pain. Lower extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: CK 336 with an MB of 9.7. Troponin was 8.4.
Chem-7 was normal with a BUN of 8 and a
creatinine of 0.9. Hematocrit was 42. White count was 7.
Platelets 196. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis
deviation , normal intervals. There were Q-waves inferiorly and
anteriorly with poor R-wave progression and persistent S in V6.
There were slight ST segment increased elevations in V2 of 1 mm and
T-wave inversions in V2 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Due to her history of cerebrovascular accident ,
no thrombolysis was attempted. She was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit and treated overnight with increased
dosages of beta blocker and had intermittent symptoms. She went to
catheterization and was found to have 100% left anterior descending
with right to left collaterals and poor distal flow as well as a
90% mid and 90% distal right coronary artery with significant
vessel tortuosity. The left anterior descending was percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplastied with question of distal
dissection which required stent placement. It led to initial good
result. A wire was passed through the stent , but no balloon could
be passed. There was no proximal stent placed due to poor outflow.
The plan was to return to Catheterization Laboratory to attempt
right coronary artery stenting. However , she subsequently spiked a
temperature to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. She was pan cultured and
her sheaths were removed. No antibiotics were started at that
time. Her urine subsequently grew greater than 100 , 000 E. coli ,
and she was started on levofloxacin with plan for a repeat
catheterization once afebrile x 24 hours. She underwent repeat
catheterization and had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the right coronary artery lesion. She was
transferred to the floor on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/12.</PHI> On the night at the procedure ,
she had an episode of desaturation to the mid 80 percent range on
room air. A chest x-ray revealed a question of congestive heart
failure vs. a right upper lobe infiltrate. She had another fever
to 102.2 , and she was pan cultured. Her diuresis was increased at
that time.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/13</PHI> , the patient began to show signs of paranoia and
inappropriate behavior , and a psychiatry consultation was obtained.
The patient described visual perception about her room being
smaller and was complaining about changes in her medications
without her being informed. Psychiatry felt that she was delirious
and they recommended getting her family more involved to help
reorient the patient. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/15</PHI> , the patient was oriented and in her
usual state of mental status according to her cardiologist , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Salas Usha--Nannette.</PHI> The patient was demanding to go home at that time. Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Salas Usha--Nannette.</PHI> preferred to have a dobutamine MIBI test performed prior to
her discharge , but it was decided that this could be done at a
later time as an outpatient.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day
for 5 days. 2. Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
3. Atenolol 50 mg PO b.i.d. 4. Synthroid 175 mcg PO q.d. 5.
Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. for chest pain. 6. Nitropatch 0.4
mg per hour topical q.d. 7. Ranitidine 150 mg PO b.i.d. 8.
Simvastatin 40 mg PO q.h.s. 9. Insulin 70/30 30 units subcu q.a.m.
and 18 units subcu q.p.m. 10. Plavix 75 mg PO q.d. x 30 days.
FOLLOW-UP CARE: The patient was to follow-up with her primary care
physician the week of discharge and to follow-up
with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Salas Usha--Nannette.</PHI> the following week. She was to have her thyroid
function tested in 6 weeks. She was advised to check her
fingerstick sugars four times a day , keep a diary of those numbers
in order for her insulin dosage to be adjusted.

cell count of 11.4 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelet count
267. SMA-7 revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarbonate 25 , BUN 34 , creatinine 2.1 , glucose 238. Creatinine
kinase was 12. Troponin I was 0.17. Electrocardiogram on
admission was significant for a supraventricular tachycardia at 140
beats per minute. There were no ST segment elevations and no acute
changes. Chest x-ray was significant for low volume in the right
lung. The left lung was essentially clear. There was no
compression. Echocardiogram on admission was suggestive of
pericardial tamponade.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to General Medical
Service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 26</PHI> , 2000 and taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where he was found to have pericardial
tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was attempted in the catheterization
laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 26</PHI> , 2000 , however it was complicated by right
ventricular puncture. The patient was transferred to the operating
room emergently on <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 26</PHI> , 2000 for right ventricular puncture
repair and for pericardial window. The patient was followed by the
Surgical Service postoperatively until his cardiac and pulmonary
function were stable. He was transferred back to the Medical
Service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 30</PHI> , 2000 for further evaluation and treatment of
pain and further evaluation of his renal function. Hospital course
by treatment issues as follows: 1 ) Chronic pain: The patient's
pain was felt to be likely due to chronic back conditions and also
pericardial pain. The patient was given narcotics , however became
somnolent requiring Narcan reversal. Pain Service consultation
suggested a regimen of Ultram , Vioxx and Prednisone. The patient
showed improvement on this regimen. In addition , the patient
received steroid trigger point injections with some symptomatic
relief.
2 ) Acute tubular necrosis: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 30</PHI> , 2000 through <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 31</PHI> ,
2000 , the patient had increase in his creatinine to 2.5 thought to
be of pre-renal etiology secondary to Lasix he had received on the
Surgical Service. He received fluid boluses improving his
creatinine. However , he developed hypernatremic diuresis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 3</PHI> , 2000 through <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 5</PHI> , 2000 which was thought to be a post
acute trivial necrosis diuresis. He was treated with continuous
intravenous fluids of D5 1/2 normal saline with improvement. By
<PHI TYPE="DATE">August 6</PHI> , 2000 , his creatinine continued to improve to a level of
1.1 , and the patient's diuresis subsided.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/29/2910</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SUPERFICIAL THROMBOPHLEBITIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: SLEEP APNEA , HISTORY OF RECURRENT
DVT'S , GERD.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">TCWRM</PHI> is a 50 year old woman
followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wilcox Zola</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> Clinic
with a history of recurrent DVTs who presented with pleuritic chest
pain and left lower extremity calf pain. She had a DVT about 10
years ago in the left lower extremity. She was coumadinized at that
time for 3 months. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1994 she had an abdominal hernia
repair and had recurrent DVT by LENIs but was not treated. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/09</PHI>
she presented again with a left lower extremity pain and was found
to have an acute and chronic deep venous thrombosis and was
anticoagulated with Heparin and changed to Coumadin at home. The
patient was poorly compliant with her Coumadin. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1995
she was too depressed to take her Coumadin. Her INR dropped. She
had sharp chest pain like gas over her precordium. The pain cleared
spontaneously. Eventually she called her <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> primary doctor , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">ZX</PHI> complaining of this pain and was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> for rule out MI and rule out PE. VQ scan at that
time was low probability. She was discharged on Coumadin 5mg a day
and Lasix 20mg a day for lower extremity edema. A dobutamine MIBI
was also performed and was negative. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/22</PHI> she came to the EW
complaining of chest pressure and left lower extremity swelling.
She reported that since <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/21</PHI> she started having right anterior
chest pain with chest wall pain which was increased with deep
ventilation , no cough. She did have some increased shortness of
breath and she reported increased swelling and pain of the left
lower extremity and overall was feeling poorly.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is as above and also includes obesity and
osteoarthritis of the knees.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lasix , Zoloft.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was obese black female. Temperature 98.1 ,
heart rate 72 , blood pressure 138/80.
Respiration is 20. 02 saturation on 4 liters was 96%. HEENT:
Unremarkable other than obesity and a sick sounding voice. Chest:
Clear to auscultation. Cardiac Exam: Regular rate and rhythm with a
II/VI systolic murmur over the left sternal border , no S3 , no S4.
Abdomen: Obese , soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left lower extremity
was tender in the calf but not warm , no erythematous. She did have
trace edema. Her pulses distally were 2+ on both sides.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable for a hematocrit of 47 , a white
count of 5.2 , platelets of 236 , normal
SMA7 , a PT of 13.9 and INR of 1.3 , a PTT of 31.5. Chest x-ray
showed no acute infiltrate. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at
78 with an axis of 58 , normal intervals , Q in III , and F in I ,
upright Ts in III , no RVH , no strain compared with prior EKGs. ABG
on room air was pH of 7.39 , PC02 of 47 and P02 of 57 , 88%
saturation. LENIs showed no right DVT , a left greater saphenous
vein superficial venous thrombosis , no change compared with <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/10/10.</PHI>
A VQ scan was low probability and when compared to the study of
<PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1995 was entirely unchanged.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , heparinized and begun on
Coumadin with a goal PTT of 60-80 and INR of 2-3.
Her calf pain was felt secondary to superficial thrombophlebitis
and post phlebitic syndrome. Interventional Radiology was consulted
to obtain a PA gram , however they felt that the risk of the
procedure outweighed the benefits given that her VQ scan was
entirely unchanged from prior. Her hypoxia seemed related more to
her sleep apnea. She was started on CPAP , which she tolerated
rather poorly , however was encouraged to continue to use it given
her potential long-term benefits. She had an 02 saturation on room
air in the high 80s to low 90s , which improved when she used the
CPAP. There was an initial thought that there may be cellulitis in
the left lower extremity , however this was born out clinically and
she was initially started on I.V. oxacillin in the Emergency Room
but this was stopped after one day. Of note , her chest pain seemed
to be quite esophageal or reflux related and she was started on
Axid with remarkable decrease in her symptoms. Sputum culture was
obtained and showed oral flora. She had no infiltrate on chest
x-ray and was not treated for bronchitis either.
DISPOSITION: She was therefore discharged in stable condition to
follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">ZX</PHI> in Clinic as well as the Sleep
Study Lab recommended that she follow up with ENT to see if any
surgical options were available to her in correcting her sleep
apnea. MEDICATIONS: Lasix 20mg p.o. q day , Coumadin 5mg p.o.
q.h.s. , Zoloft 50mg p.o. q day , Axid 150mg p.o. b.i.d. She will
follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wilcox Zola</PHI> in Clinic and in the ENT Clinic 1-2
weeks after discharge. She will also follow up in Coumadin Clinic
two days after discharge to have her INR checked in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> .

SSCP radiating to left neck that took breath
away initially but then had no
SOB/diaphoresis/N/V. Started while sitting and drinking coffee
and smoking tobacco- relieved in ER after 2 hours
with 2 SL NTG. Pt has h/o chest pain in past and
had <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/07</PHI> admit with dobutamine echo that was
negative except for hyperdynamic LV , cath 10 years ago
at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">DSIH</PHI> negative. New med this month is

<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/4.</PHI> Pt ruled out for MI with 3 negative sets of cardiac enzymes.
myocardial PET scan was negative for ischemia. LDL level was excellent
at 76. Pt's chest pain seems to have been noncardiac. She will be
discharged on baby ASA and atenolol.
Pulm: encouraged smoking cessation.
GI: Nexium. HEME: anemia , ferritin was 5 , suggestive of Fe deficiency.
Pt no longer has menstrual periods , so seems most likely GI blood
loss. Pt will need workup as outpatient. Pt is allergic to FeSO4 and
Fe gluconate , so will not write prescription for this. She has had Fe
infusions in the past w/no problem. This will need to be addressed as
an outpatient. Psych:
Continued home meds except dexadrine- stimulant in setting of r/o MI.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The pt is a 58 yo man with NIDDM , HTN , elevated
cholesterol , and CRI , who presented to his PCP <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/15</PHI> c/o 2D of SS chest
pressure. The patient has had prior admissions for chest pressure
but negative ETT 1998-1999 ( ETT-mibi 1999 with no fixed
or reversible defects , EF 50% ). He reports that
2D ago he developed SS chest pressure with L
arm tingling/pain; episode occured at rest and
lasted 10-15'. He has had a few episodes per day
since , almost all at rest ( the patient went up a
few flights of stairs last night without difficulty ).
Not associated with N/diaphoresis/SOB. Did not change with position.
The pt's wife feels that his sx are similar to his complaints in 1999.
The patient reported a history of "heavy/labored breathing" over past
few weeks , concurrent with some weight gain ( the patient had been
trying to lose weight but "lost his motivation" and
went from 275-&gt;305 <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/01-&gt;present</PHI> ).
No PND/orthopnea/DOE , + some mild swelling
around ankles. Pt also reports URI sx over past
week with dry cough/stuffiness , no f/c , +
mild nausea. URI sx resolved before chest
pressure episodes began. The pt presented to his
PCP with this complaint and was brought to ED , given
1 SLNTG and pressure resolved. He also
received lopressor 2.5 IV/25 PO and ASA 325.
Home meds included
cardizem/amaryl/prinivil/lipitor/asa/flomax/detrol/
palmitate A. No tob since age 18. +FH early MI. PE in ED: T 96.7 , HR
80 , BP 139/80 , 100% 2L. R eye deviated laterally. Periph field
cut. Chest clear. JVP 7 cm. RRR , I/VI SEM RUSB , obese , nl abd
exam , trace pretibial edema. EKG no change from
prior. 1st set enz flat. Labs Cr 1.4 ( baseline
1.3-1.6 ).
Hospital course:
CV: CAD/ischemia: multiple CRF ,
past negative ETTs , sx unrelated to exertion but
c/w angina otherwise ( pressure/L arm paresthesia ) ,
with no assoc sx. Pt was r/o for MI by serial enz/ekgs. Cardizem was
dc'd and he was started on lopressor and transitioned to atenolol fo
r d/c ( though it was not possible to get an accurate assessment of
BP on lopressor given short stay/nitro paste in house. ) He was
continued on ACE/lipitor. Stress portion of ETT-mibi ( separate from
rest given pt's weight/need for higher doses of marker ): pt walked
for 5'20s , reached DP of 24 , 480. He had no CP or EKG changes and
only small amt SOB at max exertion. Mibi showed a small defect in
the mid-basal portion of the inf-lateral wall , which if reversible
would suggest a small area of ischemia in the OM distribution. It was
decided that the lesion , even if reversible , was of low enough risk
that the patient could go home and return for the rest portion on
Monday. He was dc'd on his adjusted meds as above and will f/u with
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vachon Nigel</PHI> Monday to arrange BP check. Pump: the patient did not s
how evidence of fluid overload on exam , and it was thought that his
inc SOB x 1 mth or more was due to his weight gain , but ECHO was o
btained for baseline study and results were pending at dc.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Brief operative note.
DATE OF SURGERY:
<PHI TYPE="DATE">09/4/21.</PHI>
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.

112 minutes. One ventricular wire was placed. The patient came
off cardiopulmonary bypass on one of Levophed.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
After the operation , the patient was transferred in stable
condition to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Upon arrival to
the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , he was noted to have low
hematocrit and was given 1 unit of packed red blood cells. After
obtaining another hematocrit level once this transfusion to
place , his hematocrit was found to be increasing appropriately.
He was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit on postoperative
day #1. While on the Cardiac Step-Down Unit , his course was
complicated by the following:
1. On postoperative day #4 , it was noted that the Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Venessa</PHI>
had some erythema on the superior portion of his mediastinal
incision that was also tender to palpation. As a precautionary
step , the patient was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , and
Flagyl. Cardiac Surgical Team elected to keep Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Venessa</PHI> in the
hospital while his mediastinal incision was observed. Over the
next several days , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Venessa</PHI> 's erythema had decreased and there
was no noted discharge from the incision. It was felt that there
was no evidence of mediastinal as Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Venessa</PHI> remained afebrile
and did not have leukocytosis. His triple antibiotic therapy was
stopped and Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Venessa</PHI> will be sent home on oral antibiotics.
Otherwise , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Venessa</PHI> did well on his hospital course and will
be discharged home on the following medications: Augmentin one

The condition responsible for causing this admission is
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Other diagnoses include
left bundle branch block , paresthesias in the fingers , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , prostatic adenocarcinoma , Gleason's score
2/4 , C5-C6 and C6-C7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and also
status post AICD and dual chamber pacer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old male
well known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York Heart
Association class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting
with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last
night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. The patient first went
to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Doris Silva Oswalt</PHI> ER then left AMA without further treatment after
waiting four hours. He reports increasing cough with white
sputum since <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/09</PHI> , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especially
over the last three days. Also there is a questionable increase
in abdominal distention. The patient had been admitted five
times in the last six months with the last admission also for
worsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which he
notably had a TEE-guided cardioversion and diuresis. He was
discharged on creatinine of 1.7. The patient freely admits that
he has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,
claiming that he has been "eating like a horse" with meat and
heavy sauces on pasta. The patient denies chest pain , fevers ,
sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to erythromycin and
penicillin , which causes a rash. He also describes an allergy to
contrast.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was alert and oriented and in
no acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80
beats per minute. His HEENT exam was unremarkable. Carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. There were no thyromegaly
and his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiac exam did demonstrate JVP of about 18 cm and also regular
rate and rhythm with an S1 , S2 as well as an S3 and 1/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. The abdominal exam was notable
for an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatile
palpable liver edge. There was no tenderness to palpation. The
extremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only trace
edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for BUN of 45 ,
creatinine of 1.6 , K of 4.3 and sodium of 136. The INR was 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular. The patient was in volume overload and his
ARB and Aldactone were held. Aggressive diuresis was undertaken
for most of this stay including an IV Lasix drip , which was later
weaned to a torsemide IV b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.
b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the IV formation in the
form of itchiness. He was also put on Zaroxolyn throughout the
stay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was later
discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/06/20</PHI> for long runs of NSVT that he had
possibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. However ,
dobutamine was started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/08/20</PHI> and this dosage was increased
gradually over <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/14/20</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15/20</PHI> to rate about 3 mcg/kg and
the patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. In addition ,
electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patient
underwent a workup for an LVAD placement including PFTs ,
peripheral and carotid Dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. He was shown to
have significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent a
contra-indication for LVAD. Discussion ongoing with the patient during his
stay revealed that he would prefer not to have the LVAD
even if he were eligible. He understood that he was not likely to live long
with the severity of his heart failure. The decision was later made to send
the patient home with a Hickman catheter placed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/16/20</PHI> , so that he could
receive home dobutamine. In terms of ischemia , the first set of
enzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an active
issue. There were no changes on EKG. In terms of rhythm , the
patient does have history of prior AFib , however , he has remained
in normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. He has had
asymptomatic runs of NSVT on the dopamine and less so on the
dobutamine as mentioned above. Currently he was paced with an
AICD. We kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well as
on tele.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. We monitored
the patient's BUN and creatinine while diuresing and although ,
the patient did have an increased BUN to about 70 , diuretic
treatment was continued as a primary goal.
3. Endo. The patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,
putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and NPH doses. Also
the patient had low TSH. This is probably due to subclinical
hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.
4. Heme. The patient is on Coumadin as an outpatient and we
titrated his INR to a goal of 2-3. The patient did have some
nosebleeds on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/3</PHI> and his Coumadin was temporarily held , but
restarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. The INR goal was
decreased less than 1.5 where the placement of Hickman catheter
with the plan to restart the Coumadin after placement.
5. Prostate. The patient does have a history of prostate
adenocarcinoma , Gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. This has been
discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has
refused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we did
consult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemed
that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration
given the degree of his heart failure.
Physical exam at discharge , in general the patient was
comfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eating
his food comfortably as far as the HEENT and neck exam his JVP
was about 10 cm. Cardiovascular exam showed occasional PVCs and
a loud P2 and S3. In general unchanged from admission.
Respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breath
sounds were equal bilaterally. His abdomen was somewhat
decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.
Extremities were warm without edema. Pulses were 1+ radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as with admission he did have
some wasted lower extremities.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
Services. The plan is to follow his INR on Coumadin and to
continue to monitor his heart for NSVT while on dobutamine. Also
consider an ARB or Aldactone. The patient has stable kidney
function with decreasing creatinine.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/15/2909</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. PULMONARY EMBOLUS
2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary
to Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness
of breath and left pleural effusion. He returns now with increased
cough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea on
exertion. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,
treated with left lumpectomy x 2 and XRT , accompanied by
chemotherapy completed in early 1990. The patient then presented in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to have
an ejection fraction of 17%. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy
felt secondary to Adriamycin toxicity. She was then treated with
Digoxin , Lasix , Captopril and Coumadin with good result. She had
subsequent development of SVT with a rapid ventricular rate of
approximately 180. The patient eventually underwent EPEP studies
with therapeutic ablation. Subsequently she had done quite well
until <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1994 when she presented with mild cough
productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and
left-sided heart failure. She was treated with increased Lasix and
Digoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in
her symptoms. She was then admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/3</PHI> after she was found to
have a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent
ultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax
requiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluid
revealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology
remaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef for
approximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then
discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10/09.</PHI> Since that time the patient has had no
improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which
remains productive of white sputum with occasional "specks of red"
and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. She is now unable to
go greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.
This is a significant change from approximately one month ago where
she was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. She has
stable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. Her weight has
increased only slightly recently. She denies any fever , chills ,
sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. She does not
anorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy as above. 2. Breast carcinoma
as above. 3. Hypothyroid 4. Depression ALLERGIES: No known drug
allergies. Habits , distant tobacco use , none since 1967 , no ETOH.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg q day , Lasix 80 mg q day , Capoten 50
mg t.i.d. , aspirin one per day , Synthroid 2 gr. per day , Tamoxifen
10 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 75 mg q day , K-Dur 1 q day. SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed without
children. She is a semi-retired Accounts Manager. FAMILY HISTORY:
There is no family history of cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.6 , blood pressure 116/65 ,
heart rate is 100 , respiratory rate 18. 02
saturation 90% on room air. The patient is alert , responsive ,
febrile and in no acute distress. Her conjunctiva are clear ,
extraocular movements intact , her oropharynx is clear. She has no
lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm at
30 degrees. Lung examination is remarkable for a few rales at the
left base , decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness
to percussion. Cardiac examination , regular rate and rhythm with
normal SI , SII , positive SIII. Abdomen is soft and non-tender ,
slightly distended. She has pitting edema almost to the knees
bilaterally. Neurological examination is non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 and
creatinine of 1.2 with a BUN of 20. CBC
demonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets
289 , Digoxin level was 1.2. Chest x-ray showed a left pleural
effusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-
consolidation. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,
normal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , no
significant change compared with <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/3/09.</PHI>
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a picture of chronic
productive cough , progressive dyspnea with low
grade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition to
new opacity on chest x-ray. This clinical picture was felt to be
mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on
underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive
infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. The
patient was started on empiric course of antibiotics including
cefotaxime and clarithromycin. She was seen in consultation by the
Pulmonary Service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressive
diuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive intervention
such as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. The patient was thus
treated with aggressive IV diuresis with excellent symptomatic
result. As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that
a chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for
possible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. She thus
underwent a chest CT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/11/09</PHI> with demonstration of a large
peripheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of a
right lower lobe pulmonary infarction. No endobronchial lesions or
lymphadenopathy were noted. Given the patient's history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the
chest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult
Team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically
for a pulmonary embolus. She was thus started on IV Heparin with
achievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadin
without complications. In addition the patient underwent lower
extremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no
evidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus. Of note , this
echocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventricle
with severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejection
fraction of 15-20%. Though the possibility that the wedge shaped
opacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather than
infarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejection
fraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,
and thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely to
alter management. The patient was discharged to home.

INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY
SERVICE: Cardiology <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF exacerbation.
2. Atrial fibrillation and flutter.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male with a
history of CAD , CHF with an ejection fraction of 30% , atrial
fibrillation ( diagnosed in 2000 , status post 4 cardioversions , on
amiodarone until <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 2005 , when it was discontinued due to skin
discoloration; since then , the patient has been on Toprol ) ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who has done well since a
stent was placed in 2002 , not requiring any hospitalizations for
cardiac-related issues. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> 2006 , he notes that he began to
feel weak with increased dyspnea on exertion and occasional
palpitations , although he denied any chest pain. He was found to
be in atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin , with
continuation of the Toprol for rate control. He was cardioverted
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 2006 , resulting in symptomatic improvement until <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 2006
when he again reportedly felt weak , had increased dyspnea with
exertion. An echocardiogram was done in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 2006 , showing an
ejection fraction of 28%. Given his increased risk for sudden
death , a single-chamber ICD was placed.
He continued to feel even more unwell towards the later end of
<PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , with episodes of nausea , diaphoresis , shortness of breath ,
and abdominal pain with exertion ( these were his typical angina
symptoms in the past ). Consequently , ETT was done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22/2921</PHI> ,
which was terminated after 1 minute when the patient's heart rate
went up to 130. Electrophysiology adjusted his ICD , still he
reports continued symptoms as previously described as well as
decreased appetite and weight gain of 15 pounds over 6 weeks. He
endorses worsening orthopnea and PND over the several weeks prior
to admission. He was started on amiodarone on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/06/2921</PHI> for
atrial fibrillation. Given his worsening symptoms , he presented
to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ingram.</PHI> 's clinic on the day of admission for evaluation. He
was admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbation
and for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrial
fibrillation.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nigel</PHI> is a retired lobbyist. He currently
lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</PHI> with his wife. He does not smoke. He does not
drink excessively. He does have an occasional glass of wine or
two at dinnertime.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for brother who died of an MI at age
58 , father who died of an MI at age 78 , and mother with
atherosclerosis.
ALLERGIES: Flagyl to which he gets edema and Demerol.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals were temperature of 95.7 ,
heart rate 80 , blood pressure 144/78 , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 97% on room air. Generally , this is a
comfortable-at-rest-appearing gentleman in no respiratory
distress. Neck shows JVP is approximately 7 cm. His heart exam
is irregularly irregular with abnormal S1 and S2 , soft S3. Soft
systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border. No S4 or rub.
No heave or palpable thrill. His lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is obese , mildly tender
without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2+ pulses and 1+ pitting edema from ankles to
thighs bilaterally. His neuro exam is grossly intact , and he is
alert and oriented x3.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 33 ,
creatinine 1.6 , glucose 218. ALT 26 , AST 29 , total bilirubin
0.3 , alkaline phosphatase 66. BNP 659. White blood cells 599 ,
hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 196 , 000. Lipids: Total cholesterol
121 , triglycerides 166 , HDL 37 , LDL 51. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with ventricular rate in the 70s. Normal intervals.
No ST changes. Echocardiogram , <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/13/2921</PHI> : Ejection fraction
30%. Left ventricular diameter , end-diastole , 6.2%; end-systole
4.8%. Septum is thin and akinetic at the apex. There is a
hypokinetic mid to distal wall , posterior and inferior wall.
Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. There is
a dilated aortic root. Chest x-ray , <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/13/2921</PHI> , shows
cardiomegaly with an interstitial process and without effusions.
PROCEDURES: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/19/2921</PHI> , the patient was started on
dofetilide.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient was started with a
diuretic regimen of Lasix 40 mg IV twice a day given that he
appeared to be volume overloaded by clinical exam. On
presentation , he was compensated for his congestive heart
failure , with a creatinine of 1.6. The daily goal for his was -2
to 2.5 L , and he did very well on this dose of Lasix for the in
and out goal. He was switched over to Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/19/2921.</PHI> His Toprol was continued in-house , but his ACE
inhibitor was held in the setting of increases in his serum
creatinine. The plan was to restart his ACE inhibitor following
complete diuresis to dry weight. There were no symptoms or signs
consistent with ischemia in-house. The patient was continued on
aspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient's history of atrial
fibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms on
Toprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished to
pursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he had
previously experienced ). It was decided to proceed with
dofetilide therapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/19/2921.</PHI> His QTc was monitored
throughout this process , and the plan was for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and DC cardioversion on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/22/2921</PHI> for further
treatment of the atrial fibrillation. The patient's Coumadin was
continued in-house for a goal INR of between 2 to 3. To achieve
this goal , he was continued on his home regimen of Coumadin.
3. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was taken
off oral hypoglycemics in-house but continued on his home dose of
Lantus 24 units before bedtime as well as an insulin sliding
scale.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: During this admission we evaluated your heart to make sure that it
was not the cause of your pain. In fact , your studies were improved from
your previous studies of yoru heart. It seems that your pain is likely
more due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we
performed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When you
have shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if
that helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in small
doses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic
form in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys
so you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge
summary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital
we would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day
instead of twice a day until Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">NSMVSU</PHI> tells you differently.Your
medications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your
admission. If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or
any other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Adjust pain medications for shoulder pain
2. Referral for physical therapy
3. Adjustment of oral hypoglycemics if FSBGs are high - oral agents have
been reduced to once daily as pt was hypoglycemic on admission

evaluated Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Unknow Urenda</PHI> , for which differential has included NASH ,
hypothyroidism , drug ( avandia? , less likely ACE or lipitor ). She
underwent an U/S guided liver bx <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/14</PHI> performed by IR. After the
procedure , she had documented hypotension with a presyncopal episode.
Immediate CT showed hematoma around her R and L liver lobes and some
peritoneal blood superior to spleen but noretroperitoneal blood. She was
sent to the ED for evaluation. Her BP normalized with NS , and she was
never tachycardic. Serial hematocrtis were 35.1 , 32.8 and 29.8. She
was not transfused. A repeat CT showed stable hematoma with
peripancreatitc stranding , and she was admitted for further observation.
After the procedure she complained of RUQ and periumbilical pain. She
currently denies pain and expresses interest in eating. Denies N/V.

HOSP COURSE:
The patient has had elevated LFTs of unknown etiology and had a liver
biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/14</PHI> after which she developed a liver hematoma by CT with Hct
drop from 35 to 29.8 ( in the context of hydration for a pre-syncope
episode ). Repeat CT showed the hematoma was stable but also showed some
peri-pancreatic fat stranding somewhat concerning for pancreatitis by
needle aggravation ( since not significant amounts of blood were observed in
the retroperitoneal area ). Lipase and amylase were slightly elevated at 85
and 74 respectively , but she had no symtpoms of abd pain , nausea , vomiting.
Recheck of lipase and amylase within 12 hours showed stable or improved
values of 69 and 74 respectively. Her Hct was stable at 31.5 upon recheck.
She had peristent absence of abdominal pain and tolerated a full diet
without complications. Her anti-hypertensive meds ( HCTZ and ACE ) were
held due to SBPs in the 100s and should be continued as outpatient as
necessary per followup with PCP <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hawkins Isreal.</PHI> Her ASA was also held and
should be restarted per Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">ITGGMN</PHI> as outpt.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">OSUSTD</PHI> is a 62 year old woman with
cardiac risk factors including
hypertension , diabetes mellitus , postmenopausal , who presents with
exertional angina x four months. On the day prior to admission ,
she had a nondiagnostic exercise tolerance test , and was admitted
for cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 11</PHI> , 1995. Upon further
questioning when the patient presented for catheterization , it was
found that she had a previous allergic reaction to intravenous
contrast dye that caused laryngeal edema. For that reason , the
patient was admitted for premedication overnight prior to
catheterization.
The patient , again , is a 62 year old , and is a patient of Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Peter.</PHI> , with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
diabetes , elevated cholesterol , a positive family history , and
being a postmenopausal woman. She first noted exertional
substernal chest pain about four months prior to admission. The
pain radiates to her left arm , and is associated with shortness of
breath , but no diaphoresis or nausea or vomiting. The pain is
relieved by rest within two minutes , or by a sublingual
Nitroglycerin , which she has used in the past week x two. Her
exercise tolerance is limited by this pain , and is diminished to
+/- 50 yards on the flat surface at present. The patient had one
episode of pain at rest three nights prior to admission. She
denies shortness of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.
She was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction on <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 23</PHI> ,
1995 , and ruled out by enzymes and electrocardiogram. She had an
echocardiogram done which revealed an ejection fraction of 60
percent , with no regional wall motion abnormalities. She had 2+
mitral regurgitation , 1+ aortic regurgitation , and 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation. The day prior to admission , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test. She went two minutes on standard Bruce
protocol , stopped secondary to diaphoresis and shortness of breath
without chest pain , and she had nondiagnostic electrocardiogram
changes. The patient was admitted for premedication for her dye
allergy and subsequently catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. She has a history of a deep venous thrombosis in 1994.
5. She has chronic renal insufficiency , with a GFR of 48 , and the
twenty-four hour urine shows 3.8 grams of protein.

7. She has vitiligo.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Aspirin q.d.
2. Enalapril 20 mg b.i.d.
3. Cardizem 300 mg q.d.
4. Insulin mixed 70/30 with 60 units in the morning and 30 in the
evening.
5. Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies include contrast dye which gives her a
rash and laryngeal edema , Penicillin which gives her
edema.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone , but has two very
supportive daughters. She has no smoking or
alcohol history.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her family history is significant for brothers who
had myocardial infarctions in their 50's and 60's ,
and a mother who had a myocardial infarction when she was 69.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination , this is a very pleasant
<PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</PHI> woman , who speaks predominantly
Spanish , who is in no acute distress. Her vital signs were a
temperature of 98.6 , heart rate 71 , blood pressure 168/70 ,
respiratory rate 18. The remainder of her examination was
significant for flat jugular venous pressure , but questionable
bruit in the left carotid. Cardiac examination was significant for
a normal S1 and S2 , with an S3 noted , no murmur. Her extremities
showed trace edema bilaterally , 2+ pulse in the left femoral , no
pulses palpated on the right , and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Her labs are significant for a creatinine of 1.7 ,
an elevated cholesterol at 294. Her urine showed
3+ protein , 1+ glucose. Her electrocardiogram was normal sinus
rhythm at 78 , with normal axis and interval , and lateral V4 through
V6 T wave flattening.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was catheterized on <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 12</PHI> ,
1995 , with results showing proximal left anterior
descending stenosis of 50 percent , mid left anterior descending
stenosis of 70 percent. The distal left anterior descending was
diffusely diseased , and her first diagonal showed a discrete
stenosis of 80 percent. On the right , she had in the proximal
right coronary artery a discrete lesion of 50 percent , and in the
mid right coronary artery diffusely diseased at 50 percent. The
patient underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the mid left
anterior descending artery stenosis from 70 percent to 10 percent.
The patient's post catheterization course was complicated by a loss
of 150 cc of blood after her right groin sheath was removed , but
the bleeding was stopped after 90 minutes of compression. Her
hematocrit on admission was 35.9 , which dropped to 30.1 after the
sheath removal , but remained stable and she was discharged with a
hematocrit of 30.8. The patient also had one mild occurrence of
chest pain post catheterization which was relieved with two
sublinguals , and showed no electrocardiogram changes.
Upon discharge , the patient was noted to have elevated liver
function tests , with an ALT going from 16 to 156 , an AST going from
16 to 65 , an alkaline phosphatase going from 87 to 171. The
patient's primary medical doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Peter.</PHI> , was notified and
agreed to workup the elevated liver function tests. The patient
was discharged on her admitting medications.

her chemo but none since and in the time leading up to her
hospitalization.
ADMISISON PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature was 98.9 , pulse 98 , blood
pressure 132/55 , respiratory rate 16 , 95% on room air. The
patient's physical exam was significant for alopecia and obesity.
She was in no acute distress , alert and oriented. Her pupils
were equal , round and reactive. Conjunctivae were pink. She was
anicteric and her oropharynx was clear. JVP was hard to assess
due to neck fullness and she wears hearing aids. The lungs were
clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds with
crackles at the left base. Cardiovascular exam was regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 , S2 and no murmur , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft and benign. Extremities had trace to 1+ edema.
The patient had an approximately 4 x 2 cm area of redness but no
swelling , positive warmth and positive tenderness on the dorsal
surface of her right hand. She had a pustular lesion on her left
fourth digit and right third digit that had been I&amp;D in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CKIW</PHI>
Urgent Care.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs are significant for creatinine of 1 , white
blood cell count of 4.33 , hematocrit of 25.5 and platelets of
108. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a leftward axis and
first degree AV block. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 72-year-old woman with
stage III or stage IV breast cancer who now presents with
paronychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.
Infectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV
vancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her
finger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within
two days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage
of her left hand's pustular lesion with improved speed of healing
and decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient's
vancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient
developed a area of redness on her left forearm that measured
approximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an
erythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear
to be blanching. At the same time , she developed a very similar
lesion on her right index finger between her MCP and PIP. The
patient was switched back to IV vancomycin and the Infectious
Disease consultants were called to assist with the management of
the patient's evolving lesions. A TTE was obtained that showed no
vegetations and serial blood cultures showed no bacteremia. The
Infectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had
paronychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation
due to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.
The concern for septic emboli for which the patient was initially
treated became less likely in the setting of the new lesions that
were not in distribution that has been consistent with septic
emboli. 48 hours later the patient was again switched from
vancomycin to Keflex and within 12 hours developed new
maculopapular rash on her right neck and furuncles on her left
and right outer labia that were exquisitely painful. The patient
was given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on
Keflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether
the patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she
was not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and
topical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the
right neck quickly resolved and the furuncles on her labia were
symptomatically managed with sitz bath three times daily in
addition to her oral cephalosporin antibiotic.
Throughout the course of evolving dermatologic findings that the
patient experienced and the pain associated with them the patient
had continued to have absolutely no systemic complications
associated with these lesions. In particular , she did not have
fever at all during the course of her hospitalization , she did
not have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,
and her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.
The patient was started on IV acyclovir when her new rash
developed and on the day of discharge was switched over to
Valtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection
though cultures remained pending at the time of discharge. The
patient will be discharged on Keflex and Valtrex to complete a
course of ten days on each.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes , was
placed on a weight based insulin regimen with good effect during
the course of her hospitalization. On discharge , she will resume
her Lantus 40 units nightly.
Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of diastolic
dysfunction with a clean cath in 2005. Her aspirin , statin ,
Zestril , Cardizem , Lasix and nitrates were continued during the
course of her hospitalization in the same way that she takes them
at home with very well controlled blood pressures and no issues
with her rhythm.
The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea but does not
use CPAP and do not have any difficulties with her oxygenation
even while sleeping.
Heme: The patient was initially anemic and thrombocytopenic on
admission. She received one unit of packed red blood cells and
her hematocrit remained stable through the duration of her
hospitalization.
Oncology: The patient has ductal carcinoma and inflammatory
breast cancer that is likely stage IV and she is status post
cycle 2 of 16 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan with a plan for surgical removal after her
chemotherapy.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
services and physical therapy at home.

the patient is legally blind. He is able to see most objects at
about 6 or 7 feet away from him.
His chest x-ray showed a right middle opacification concerning
for an infiltrative pneumonia. His EKG on admission post cath
showed a rate of 98 , sinus rhythm , and ST elevations 2 mm in V2
through V3 and ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF. Labs on
admission were significant for creatinine of 1.4 up from a

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. CV: Ischemia. An emergent cath on admission on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/05/19</PHI>
showed two-vessel disease and 100% LAD , osteal lesion , and a 90%
marginal 1 lesion. The LAD was stented with a 3.5 x 8 mm and a
3.0 x 13 mm and a 3.0 x 18 mm Cipher stents all to 0%. The
marginal 1 was not stented during this cath. The patient's CK
peaked at 10 , 438 , and a CK-MB at 452 and his troponin at 721.
The patient was transferred to the CCU after his cath. He was
treated with aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , Integrilin
x12 hours. The patient recovered well except for his heart rate
remained in tachycardiac at 90 to 110 range despite Lopressor
which was increased to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. With the setting of
tachycardia , he developed ST elevation in 1 aVL with ST
depressions and 3 aVF in the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/07/19</PHI> , although his
cardiac enzymes continued to turn down. The patient underwent a
second cath on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/08/19</PHI> , which showed that all his stents placed
in his LAD previously remained patent. The marginal 1 was
stented at this time with Cipher stent 0. The patient was doing
very well after his second procedure. His heart rate remained
slightly tachycardiac , the patient experienced no further EKG
changes.
2. Pump: The patient was on Lopressor and captopril , and his
blood pressure remained stable after his procedures. Echo on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/06/19</PHI> showed an LVEF of 30% as well as akinesis of the mid
distal anterior wall felt in the entire apex. There was
hypokinesis of the basal anterior septum and the basal to mid
lateral wall with preserved function of the basal to mid inferior
and posterior wall. The apex is near aneurysmal. The patient
was put on heparin GTT given the risk of intraventricular
thrombus. The patient was started on Coumadin prior to
discharge.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient remained mildly tachycardiac.
His Lopressor was titrated up to 100 mg q.i.d. for rate control
but no concerning arrhythmias were noted on telemetry. His sinus
tachycardia was thought to be secondary to a bacterial pneumonia.
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes. The hemoglobin
A1c was 10.57 demonstrating the patient's conservative treatment
was insufficient. He was started on NPH and insulin sliding
scale in the hospital. Metformin was started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/11/19</PHI> , and he
was restarted on Glucotrol before discharge. Diabetic teaching
was instituted.
5. Renal: Mucomyst was given before and after both of his
caths. His creatinine turned into his baseline of 1.2.
6. Heme: The patient was sent home on Coumadin given his
echocardiogram significant for near aneurysmal LV and a
hypokinetic apex. The patient will need to be followed in
Coumadin Clinic. Code status for this patient remained full
throughout his hospitalization.
7. Pulmonary: The patient was noted to be febrile and to have a
right middle lobe infiltrate on admission. The patient was
treated with five days of levofloxacin but remained febrile and
tachycardiac. The patient was started on azithromycin for a
total of five-day course. The patient defervesced after 24 hours
of being on azithromycin. Also of note , on a follow-up chest
x-ray prior to discharge , was read as the patient having a
question of a cavitating lesion in his right lobe. It was
recommended that this be followed up as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was discharged on following medications.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tab sublingual q.5 minutes x2

of <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 16</PHI> , 2003.
CC: Hypotension after dialysis
HPI: 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF ( EF 20-25% ) admitted for
hypotension after HD. He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he
developed stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. He
denied recent travels , and had remote Abx use. At <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lyman Harrison.</PHI> ,
he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30. 1 liter of
NS was given and his BP rose to 73/40.
ROS: Chronic PND , uses 1 pillow , gained 8kg in 2 weeks but compliant

CXR: R pl effusion , CMG
Assessment: Hypotension after dialysis in setting of GI
upset/diarrhea/vomiting , likely was dehydrated. The BP rose after
fluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema.
Although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about
new ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED.
Hospital course
1. CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , beta
blocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. His
cardiologist ( Dr <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">USAMN</PHI> ) recommended PET scan to assess for viable
myocardium and ischemia. His last stress test 1 year ago showed only
scarring with no ischemia. In the past , pt's wife refused for him to go
for CABG. They are reconsidering this option currently.
The results of the PET scan are as follows:
- A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild
residual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD
distribution.
- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.
- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 16</PHI> ,
2003.
The family was called to stress the importance of follow up with
cardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past )
Pump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and
pending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI.
Rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry
2. Pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. RA sats improved to
97%
3. Renal: HD MWF , home renal meds. He was dialyzed to a weight below
his previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. In the past he
has had elevated RH filling pressures after HD. The <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lyman Harrison.</PHI> was
called by the attendting renal physician ( Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">UMD</PHI> ) about his goal
weight.
4. ID: Blood cx were no growth
5. GI: He was continued on his home nexium
6. Proph: SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with
the cardiologist , Dr <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">USAMN</PHI>
Please take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on
mornings of dialysis
Please adhere to your dietary restrictions. If you gain more than 3 kg
between dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake. The diet
guidelines will be coordinated by the staff at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lyman Harrison.</PHI>

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Goodman Ontiveros</PHI> is an 81 y.o. woman who presents with one day of
chest pain , difficulty speaking , nausea , and lightheadedness. She had
URI symptoms about two weeks ago and then 5d pta developed minimal
ly productive cough and then SOB for the past 2-3 days. She denies any
noctural dyspnea or increase in number of pillows. She lives alone ,
and a reverend checks up on her daily; the day prior to admission he
suggested she go to the hospital. She does not feel that she had any
speech difficulties at that time , but when she awoke she noted
heaviness of her tongue and workd finding difficulties. In addition , she
had sweating and chest pain that radiated to her shoulder ( L&gt;R ) , and
back. This was different than her usual anginal symptoms ( which do not
involve back radiation ). The pain was pleuritic in nature , and she
denied palpitations. She also noticed nausea and had several episodes
of dry heaving. While leaving the bathroom she had a single episode of
"lightheadness." This did not involve any sensation of vertigo , or any
vision changes. She sat down immediately , and felt better within a few
seconds. There was no fall and no LOC. Around 8am , her housekeeper
came , and immediately noticed a change in Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Goodman Ontiveros</PHI> 's voice. Mrs.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Goodman Ontiveros</PHI> describes the change as a "thickening of my tongue" and some
problems finding words. She has been taking all of her medications as
prescribed over the last week.
ROS: On arrival to the floor , Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Goodman Ontiveros</PHI> noted a raised , painful
area on her L forearm. She does not recall any trauma to the area. She
denies any fever.

Hospital course by system:
Neuro: Speech difficulties: resolved by the time pt was in ER , making
diagnosis difficult. Possible etiologies include TIA or illness
exacerbating deficits from old stroke. Head CT in ER showed old
infarcts , but no acute process. Patient did not have any speech
difficulties throughout admission or other neurologic findings.
CV: ischemia: No ST changes on EKG , one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Given low probability of ischemia , no further enzymes were
drawn. Pump: EF 55% , patient was normotensive even after d/c of
some of her home HTN meds ( see renal ). Rhythm: pt was on telemetry for
first day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib.
Pulm: PNA: pt had left lower lobe opacity on CXR. Decision was made to
start antibiotics. Pt had a positive d-dimer , but PE was very unlikely
in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient has a
history of CHF , but had no signs of CHF on exam during this
hospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema.
Renal: ARF: Creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of
1.2-1.3. Given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam ,
this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. Her
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute to
further ARF , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1L ) and her
creatinine improved. However , after restarting her medications her Cr
again bumped to 1.8. Her UA was unremarkable. She was d/c home off
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a Cr of 1.8 presuming that sh
e was still prerenal. The plan is for VNA to check her chem7 in 3days
days , results to go to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yarber.</PHI> for monitoring and deciding when to
restart her medications.
MSK: Pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hosp
for the first night. A radiograph was negative for fracture and it was
felt to be a small hematoma. The pain remitted with Tylenol. At
discharge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced.
Heme: Anticoagulation. She was maintained on her home dose of INR was
maintained in a theraputic range. This will have to be closely
monitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. Her INR was 3 after 2
days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by VNA 3 days
after discharge , results to be followed by <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lillian Huey.</PHI>
Endo: D.M. Pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd given
her worsening renal insufficiency. Fingersticks remained in acceptable
range ( 100-148 ) during admission.
Dispo: to home with close VNA followup ( daily ). Pt will have weight
and BP checked qd. She will have Chem-7 and INR drawn on Thursday and
Monday , and the results will be called to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yarber.</PHI> ( <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> ). She will
finish 6 more days of Levo ( total 10 ).
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you develop a fever , become short of breath , have increasing left arm
pain , or any other symptoms that concern you , call your doctor.
The visiting nurse is an important followup to your
hospitalization.Your diabetes medication was changed to glipizide -stop
taking the micronase. Your lasix , lisinopril and colchicine have been
stopped , don't restart them until Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yarber.</PHI> tells you to restart. Your othe
medications are the same. Weigh yourself daily and if your weight increa
ses more than 2lbs in 2 days call Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yarber.</PHI>
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. VNA will check BP and weight qd. Any BP &gt; 140/90 or wt gain of 2

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old male with
crescendo angina. The patient has a
long history of coronary artery disease and suffered an anterior
septal myocardial infarction in 1989. The patient did well on
medical management , until recently when he has developed increasing
fatigue and angina with decreased exertion. The patient had an
exercise stress thallium test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-10-07</PHI> , which showed ST depression
in V5 after 6 minutes and 38 seconds. The thallium aspect of the
test showed apical inferior reperfusion defect. A cardiac
catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-07</PHI> , showed a 60 to 80% lesion at the left
anterior descending , 60% lesion of the first diagonal and 50%
lesion of the circumflex , 100% lesion of the right coronary artery.
Inferiorly , the heart was noted to be akinetic with areas of
dyskinesis. The ejection fraction was 45%. PA pressures were
32/20 with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm/HG.
The patient now presents with increasing angina , failing medical
therapy. The patient denied a history of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea , pedal edema. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
71F with extensive PMHs including CHF , diastolic
dysfxn ( EF 60% ) , AS , AFib , DM , CRI , OSA p/w progressive dyspnea , fatigue ,
periph edema , weight gain. Admitted 3wks ago w/similar complaints -
was diuresed heavily w/~8lb weight loss
and symptomatic relief. Post D/C , did well for a
few days , then started developing progressive DOE ,
fatigue , orthopnea , as well as weight gain
of ~8-10lbs. On admission , she could not walk more than few feet w/o
SOB. Pt claimed that she was compliant with her medications and
practiced dietary
discretion. On day of present admission , pt presented w/CHF flare ,
acute
on chronic RF. In ED , BP 87/45 , P 75 , 96%RA , afeb. EKG showed AF with
no ST-T changes , enz neg. HCT 30.7 , BUN 105 , Cr
2.4 ( baseline Cr
~2.0 ) PE: AOx3 , resp distress , JVP? , S1S2 ,
3/6 AS murmur , trace rales , abd? , 3+ pitting LE
edema. Impression: 71yo woman w/CHF , AFib , AS , DM ,
CRI , w/hx of recent CHF exacerbation now p/w with
vol overload , dyspnea , and renal failure. Etiology of CHF exacerbation
unclear:she r/o for MI , no worsening of her afib , no si/sx's of
infection ,
no hx to suggest dietary indiscretion , medical non-compliance , lack of
medications CV:Isch- no evidence of ischemia: pt r/o for MI with
negative enzymes. PUMP: Pt was gently diuresed ~2L/day on Torsemide
100 IV TID x 4 days with excellent response and then switched to her
home diuretic regiment of 100 mg BID of PO torsemide and 5 mg PO
Zaroxolyn on the day prior to discharge still with good diuretic
effect. Her admission wt was 132.9KG and on day of discharge she
weighed 125.8kg: net total loss of 7.1 kg or 15.6 lbs per this admit.
During this admission , strict I/O's , daily weight. fluid
and salt restriction were maintained. She was not re-started on
Cozaar given BP's in low range with SBP:90;s. RHYTHM: chronic afib
w/good rate
control w/o agent and no rate issues during this admission. Pt is not
on coumadin given hx
of GI bleed. Pulm: Pt was continued on her Advair disk , flonase , prn
nebs. She was placed on CPAP @ night and did well with cpap;
arrangements were made for pt to have her CPAP at home changed to
hospital setting and equipment. HEME:1 )ANEMIA
Pt was admitted with HCT of 30.7 , lower then her normal. She had 3
positive stool guiaic's , low normal Fe
studies , and stable HCT during this admission. Her ASA was stopped 2/2
concern for GIB. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with her GI doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Oleary Huff-Uram</PHI> 2 days after discharge.2 )THROMBOCYTOPENIA:pt had a drop in
platlets that was initially concerning , but ultimately appeared
to be lab variation with its resolution on the next blood
draw. RENAL:Pt was admitted with acute
on chronic renal failure felt to be secondary to decreased CO. Her CRT
elevation gradually resolved from 2.4 on admission to 1.8 at time of
discharge. Her celebrex was stopped 2/2 ARF.
Proph: Pt was placed on
Heparin 5000u SC BID for DVT prophylaxis and Nexium
40 GI:Pt was noted to have elevated LFT's on admission labs. Her peak
LFT's were ALT:368 , AST: 274 , AP:158 with nl BILIT 0.5 and biliD
0.3. DDX included congestion vs infection vs medications. hepatitis
deemed unlikely but hep panel still pending at time of discharge.
Since pt's LFT's did not resolve with excellent diuresis , it was felt
that it was not likely due to congestion. Most likely etiology was felt
to be reaction to drug. Pt was taken off the following hepatotoxic
meds: tylenol , statin , percocet , allopurinol. She was continued on her
tamoxifen , although case reports of hepatotoxicity noted; other
consideration included the neurontin , but lft's began to normalize on
medication. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with GI , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Oleary Huff-Uram</PHI> 2
days following discharge. FEN: Pt's lytes were aggressively repleted;
she required significant K repletion each day and will be d/c'd on K.
She was maintained on a NA and fluid restriction and placed on a
cardiac and diabetic diet. ( ENDO ): DM: Pt was initially placed on RISS
given concern for hypogylcemia and her home regiment was gradually
added to her inpatient regiment with elevated FS.
Pt was stable at time of discharge , sx's much improved , and scheduled f
or follow-up with cardiologist and CHF nurse on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/06/18.</PHI>

admission to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Trisha?</PHI> .
- Pt has had multiple episodes of
asymptomatic
afib , aflutter , and atrial tachycardia , with RVR into the 150's , with
rate responding
well to 5mg IV lopressor. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/18/17</PHI> , lopressor increased to
75mg po tid in hopes of achieving rhythm/rate
control , unsucessfully. EP was consulted as to a possible ablation
procedure , but felt that medical management , if possible , would be a
better solution , given that multifocal atrial tachycardias and afib
would not necessary be resolved with an ablation procedure. The
patient also preferred medical management. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19/17</PHI> , verapamil
40mg po tid was added to the regimen , with patient still having
episodes of rapid heart rate. Verapamil was increased to 80mg po
tid with resulting rate control. However , patient had two episodes
of asymptomatic low BP ( 90/50 ). On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/20/17</PHI> , verapamil was decreased
to 60mg po tid , with both HR and BP control. Abnormal rhythms
continued , without RVR.
- Given afib/aflutter rhythms , patient was placed on coumadin 5mg po qd
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19/17</PHI> ( prior to his procedure , he was maintained on heparin drip ,
and immediately post-procedure , he was maintained on integrilin drip ).
- Pt placed on statin at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Trisha?</PHI> ; maintained on statin at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> . Patient
maintained on asa.
- New d/c medications: Given difficulty of maintaining patient's heart
rate and blood pressure , pt was d/c'ed on verapamil and lopressor ,
both tid drugs. At f/u appt with cardiologist or PCP , this regimen
can be altered as appropriate. Pt also d/c'd on coumadin , plavix
( for 6months ) , and simvastatin.
Pulm - Severe COPD , treated with home O2.
Baseline O2 92% on 2L , and SOB with minor exertion. Pt
was tx w/ steroids until 6 months ago.
Continued on theophylline , flovent , serevent ,
guifenisin , atrovent inhaler prn. Stable while in hospital.
Endo - Pt was given one dose of solumedrol in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Trisha?</PHI> . FS high ( low 200's )
on admission; he was begun on an insulin SS , but did not require
insulin while in hospital.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please return to hospital ER if you have any chest pain , increased
shortness of breath or oxygen requirement , dizziness , lightheadedness ,
fainting , or any other concerns. If you have palpitations or a
sensation of a racing heart , please call your primary care doctor.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( to CCU admission ):
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/24/21.</PHI> He had been behaving unlike
himself and was having black tarry stools for two days. The patient was found
to
be guaiac positive. A head CT showed no new lesions but did show
multiple infarcts that were known to be old. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/25/21</PHI> , the
patient had an EGD showing clot in the distal esophagus. This
clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.
Around midnight on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/26/21</PHI> , the patient became borderline
hypertension for an unclear reason. His hematocrit was
stable. The patient's ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
were held. Also , the patient's Lasix was
held. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/26/21</PHI> at around 4:00 a.m. , the patient was
reportedly having fitful sleeping and went to the bathroom. Soon
afterwards , the nurse noticed that the patient was having more
ectopy on telemetry. Soon after 4:30 a.m. , the patient was
either found unresponsive or ventricular fibrillation was seen on
telemetry and a code was called. The rhythm was shown to be
V-fib. Chest compressions were initiated , and the patient was
shocked. Soon thereafter , he had two more shock episodes for
V-fib and was loaded on amiodarone 300 mg IV x1. Soon
thereafter , his V-fib terminated and subsequently , the patient
had an episode of slow PEA treated with atropine , epinephrine ,
calcium and magnesium. Code labs showed a potassium of 3.3. The
patient was intubated. A left femoral line was placed. The
patient was transported to the CCU with stable blood pressure on
neosynephrine. He was easily weaned off neosynephrine. The
patient does not have any history of an arrhythmia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient's past medical history is significant for:;
1. coronary artery disease status post CABG ( SVG to RCA ) with mitral valve
replacement in 1999. In 2003 , the
patient underwent catheterization for unstable angina. The LAD
and D1 were stented. In 2004 , the patient underwent
catheterization for unstable angina showing restenosis of D1
which was re-stented.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. CVA.
4. Seizure disorder.
5. Subdural hematoma while on Coumadin , status post burr hole
evacuation.

temperature 98.3 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 122/73 , respiratory
rate 16 , O2 sat 97% on room air. He was not in any acute
distress. He was alert and oriented x3. He was interactive and
appropriate. Skin was normal. HEENT showed an old left-sided
facial droop which was unchanged per patient and the family. The
JVP was 6 cm. There was no lymphadenopathy. The chest was
clear. Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , no
extra sounds or murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. Extremities
had 2+ pulses without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurological
exam showed a left-sided facial hemiparesis. Otherwise , cranial
nerves II through XII were intact. The patient had 4/5 strength
on the left side , 5/5 strength on the right side. Toes were
downgoing.
ADMISSION LABS:
Labs on admission were notable for a creatinine of 1.7 , glucose
of 237 , hematocrit of 37.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/25/21</PHI> , elective inpatient EGD for heme-positive black stool
performed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wagner Henson</PHI> in the presence of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hoover Quarles.</PHI>
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/29/21</PHI> , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrest
performed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wilford Nelly</PHI> with stent placement in the
circumflex.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/3/21</PHI> , dual chamber ICD placed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nicolas , Oren. Uhlman , Outlaw. Oretha</PHI>
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease and
mitral valve replacement. He was initially admitted for an upper
GI bleed and was then admitted to the CCU status post V-fib arrest
and found to have NSTEMI. His course in the CCU was as follows:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: NSTEMI. The patient had a troponin elevation
beginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the NSTEMI
occurred
and then caused V-fib arrest. The peak troponin was 111.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,
and occlusion of the SVG graft. Two drug-eluting stents were placed
in the left circumflex. The patient was treated with aspirin ,
Plavix , beta-blocker , and ACE. The patient's beta-blocker and
ACE doses were titrated during his hospital stay. The patient
was also taken off of Lipitor briefly due to concern about his
liver function. At discharge , he is being restarted on his
outpatient doses of Lipitor as well as a Fibrate.
B. Pump: The patient had congestive heart failure causing
pulmonary edema. By echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%
with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe global
hypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. The patient
diuresed well during his CCU stay and on the floor. His I's and
O's were followed. He was net negative , and he was discharged
at a weight of 87 kilos. The patient had an echo to evaluate
for dyssynchrony. This echo did not find significant evidence of
dyssynchrony.
C. Rhythm: The patient had a V-fib arrest and returned to
normal sinus rhythm. He received an amiodarone load as well as
amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. After he stabilized , the amiodarone was
discontinued after AICD implantation on on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/3/21.</PHI> The implantation itself
was uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due to
administration of prophylactic Ancef. The patient was switched
to vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. His allergic
symptoms
resolved with one dose of IV Benadryl.
2. GI: The patient came in with an upper GI bleed. A bleeding
vessel at the GE junction was clipped. The patient had a
transient LFT elevation consistent with shock liver. LFTs were
followed and declined appropriately during his hospitalization
and normalized before discharge. The patient was also maintained
on a proton pump inhibitor during his stay.
3. Hematocrit: The patient was transfused two units of red blood
cells on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/28/21</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/29/21.</PHI> His hematocrit remained stable therafter. The
patient was taking Lovenox as an
outpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. During
the peri-procedure period for his ICD implantation , the patient
was switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparin
drip for four days after device implantation. At that time , he
was restarted on his outpatient regimen of Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d.
4. Neuro: The patient has a history of CVA with a residual left
hemiparesis. These symptoms were stable. The patient was also
seen by the Psychiatry Service to evaluate his memory deficits
and abilities to make decisions. The Psychiatry team recommended
that the patient be followed by Neurology after discharge and
that the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatric
testing for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits.
5. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary edema resolved with
diuresis.
6. ID: The patient presented with fever and an elevated white
blood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chest
x-ray. This patient was covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl for
three days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. During
hospitalization , he did have very transient low-grade
temperatures on two other occasions. Cultures including chest
x-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. The patient was afebrile prior
to discharge. As of the day of
this dictation , C. difficile tests were also negative.
7. Renal: The patient's creatinine was elevated reaching a peak
of 1.9 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/28/21</PHI> in the setting of his cardiac arrest. The
patient's creatinine normalized and on the day prior to discharge
was 1.2.
8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow.
Initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced to
mechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge.
9. Endocrine: The patient is diabetic and was maintained on NPH
22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. At the time of discharge ,
the patient's blood sugars were well controlled. He is being
discharged on Lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinet
dose ) as well as a NovoLog sliding scale for coverage during meals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
On the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile. Heart rate
70-80s , blood pressure 90-120/66-70. Oxygen saturation 96-98% on
room air. Weight 87 kilograms. Pertinent labs include a
creatinine of 1.2 , hematocrit of 36. The patient's exam showed
continuing left facial hemiparesis. Lungs were clear. Cardiac
exam was notable for a mechanical S1 , no extra sounds or murmurs.
His abdomen was soft , and the ICD placement site was well healed
without swelling , tenderness or erythema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.
2. Lipitor 40 mg p.o. daily.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Downs</PHI> is a 72 year old man who
is status post a coronary artery
bypass graft and mitral valve replacement who presents with
recurrent unstable angina. He was admitted to the Cardiology
Service for cardiac catheterization. His history began in l976
when he presented with substernal chest pain and shortness of
breath. In l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarction
and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary artery
bypass graft with mitral valve replacement. He did fairly well
with no recurrent symptoms until <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l989 when he presented
with congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial
infarction. A thallium exercise treadmill test revealed
inferoapical ischemia and the patient was continued with medical
therapy. He did well until one to two weeks prior to admission
when he developed chest pain which radiated to the left arm and was
persistent for three hours after which time it was treated with
Nitroglycerin at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nanci Norman Clinic</PHI> and resolved. An exercise
treadmill test was stopped secondary to shortness of breath and
thallium scan revealed inferoapical scarring and septal apical
reperfusion abnormality. The patient subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> which
revealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft and
patent posterior descending artry graft and OM2 graft. His native
vessels were remarkable for significant disease throughout his left
anterior descending , an l00% circumflex lesion at the obtuse
marginal l , l00% proximal obtuse marginal lesion , and l00% right
coronary artery occlusion. Left ventriculogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 0.6 with apical hypokinesis. The patient was
referred to Cardiac Surgery Service for evaluation and coronary
artery bypass grafting was elected. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Remarkable for diet controlled diabetes mellitus , history of an
asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm , and a hiatal hernia.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Inderal , Procardia , Aspirin , Lasix , Pepcid ,
Maalox , Nitrol Paste , and intravenous Heparin. ALLERGIES: No
known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a
longstanding cigarette smoking history which was stopped in l98l.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant moderately obese male in
no acute distress. HEAD/NECK: Within
normal limits. CHEST: Clear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate
and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema with good peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
bradycardia with first degree AV block and
right bundle-branch block.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On <PHI TYPE="DATE">l2/26/90</PHI> , patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting and a left internal mammary
artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively , the
patient developed intermittent rhythm disturbances with several
episodes of ventricular ectopy and bradycardia which were not felt
to be significant enough to warrant further investigation by the
Cardiology Service. The patient developed a blood culture that was
positive for enterobacter and the patient subsequently underwent
placement of a Hickman catheter to receive a four week dose of
Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone. This was well tolerated without
complication.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. The patient is
discharged home and will receive a full course of
four weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lopressor , and Pepcid.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. STATUS POST PTCA TIMES TWO.
3. SICK SINUS SYNDROME , STATUS POST PACER
PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72 year old woman
with coronary artery disease who
is status post PTCA times two with a sick sinus syndrome , status
post DDD pacemaker , and Hodgkin's disease who presented with
unstable angina. Her cardiac risk factors include hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , family history , and past smoking history. She
had angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1992 and underwent coronary angiography in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1993 which revealed an 80% RCA lesion , 70% OM , 70% mid-LAD ,
and 50% D1. The LV-gram was normal. She had a PTCA to the RCA
lesion with a 30% residual. She had recurrent exertional angina
one month later and a repeat catheterization at that time showed no
change. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> 1993 , she had several episodes of lightheadedness
and syncope which was felt to be secondary to sick sinus
syndrome. A DDD pacemaker was placed. She later had recurrent
chest pain at rest and again went to cardiac catheterization which
showed a 70% mid LAD lesion , 30% RCA , and a normal LV-gram with 75%
ejection fraction. She underwent PTCA to the mid-LAD lesion with a
20% residual. She was then discharged on Lopressor , Procardia , and
Aspirin. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> 1993 , she underwent an ETT , and exercised
4 minutes and 35 seconds on a standard Bruce stopping due to
shortness of breath and fatigue. No ischemic changes were noted.
She has done well until two days prior to admission when she
experienced recurrent angina at rest , and was admitted to
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ivey Johanna Clinic</PHI> where she ruled out for a

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72-year-old woman with
history of diverticulitis who
presented with a diverticular abscess with nausea , vomiting and
crampy abdominal pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD , status post MI x2 , status post V. fib
arrest , status post CABG , asthma , COPD ,
sleep apnea , obesity , hypercholesterolemia , status post chole ,
status post DVT , status post Greenfield placement , status post AAA

q.d. , Afrin and Imodium p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , erythromycin , levofloxacin , IV dye , iron.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old female with a history of
diverticulitis who presented with crampy
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting times several days. CT on
admission noted a diverticular abscess. CT was unable to drain it
due to its limited size. However , the patient continued to have
crampy abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting. The patient was taken
to the OR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/3/17</PHI> for an exploratory laparotomy , sigmoid
colectomy and colostomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was maintained NPO , with an epidural for pain control , until
return of bowel function as witnessed by the gas and feces in the
colostomy bag.
By the time of discharge , the patient was ambulating with a wheeled
walker. She was tolerating a regular diet , had good pain control
on 2-4 mg q.4h. of Dilaudid. Of note , the patient has a
significant history of coronary artery disease , had a rule out MI
postoperatively with initial evidence of cardiac injury. However ,
the patient did complain of some atypical chest pain on
postoperative day #3. A repeat rule out MI illustrated a troponin
leak likely secondary to increased cardiac demands postoperatively.
The patient was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. in order to
control rates with a good effect. The patient was also continued
on a course of IV antibiotics , ampicillin , ceftazidime , Flagyl and
Diflucan. Drainage from that particular abscess eventually
revealed enterococci , yeast and Pseudomonas responsive to these
antibiotics.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: ( 1 ) Routine colostomy care and teaching.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year-old woman
followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gilmore Y. Warner</PHI> in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI>
Clinic for problems related to obesity , depression and poorly
controlled hypertension. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1994 , she complained of
right breast tenderness with a palpable nodule. A mammogram at
that time revealed mildly dense parenchyma and no calcium and an
ultrasound revealed 4 mm hypoechoic nodule compatible duct
obstruction with debris. Her symptoms of right breast tenderness
waxed and waned and follow-up ultrasound in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of 1994

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST STENT OF
THE RCA.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: EXTENSIVE CARDIAC HISTORY , DVT WITH
PE X TWO , CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ,
HEPATITIS B POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old male presenting
with unstable angina. His first presentation with coronary disease
was in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100%
occlusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplasty
of the circ to a 70% residual. He had an exercise treadmill two
months later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosis
of the circ and a 60% LAD lesion , and a 90% D1. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> of
1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. Cath
revealed 70% occlusion of the RCA , 70-80% LAD , and diffuse disease
in the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. He had diffuse
global hypokinesis and an EF of 40-50%. His angina progressed and
in 1994 he underwent a four vessel CABG , SVG to the PDA and OM-1 ,
and a LIMA to the LAD and D2. He did well until 1997 , when he
presented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddle
pulmonary embolism. He had a negative hypercoagulative workup
after this. In the recent years he has had a number of episodes of
epigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no
additional myocardial infarctions. His most recent cath in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>
of 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% LAD , and subtotal
occlusion distally , a 60% mid-RCA lesion , and patent SVG to the PDA
and the OM , as well as the LIMA to the LAD. In recent months the
patient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provoked
by walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. Most often
the pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. He denies
associated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the
pain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. The patient denies
orthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. He has never had pain at
rest. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 14th</PHI> the patient underwent an exercise treadmill
test walking five minutes on the standard Bruce protocol , reaching
a heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. He had chest
pain as well as 1 mm ST depressions. Since then his angina has
occurred with less and less exertion until the morning of
admission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chest
tightness. He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or
radiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. The
pain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advised
by his cardiologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Edison Nydia.</PHI> , to come to the Emergent
Department. In the Emergent Department he was pain free and
received aspirin and was started on heparin. EKG showed no acute
changes. CK was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , chronic DVTs with
pulmonary embolism x two , CVA , left temporal in the setting of an
INR of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. He is
now on Lovenox subcu for DVT prophylaxis. Chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B
positive , and recent eye surgery in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 2001.
ALLERGIES: Benadryl , which causes shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Avandia 4
mg p.o. b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , aspirin 325 mg q. day ,
gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , blood
pressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygen
saturation 98% on 2 L. In general , he is a 63-year-old Asian male ,
well appearing and in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive. Extraocular muscles intact. Oral mucosa are
moist. There is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy.
Neck is supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , without
wheezes or rales. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,
without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , nondistended ,
and mildly tender to palpation in the epigastrium. There is no
rebound or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused , with
no edema.
INITIAL LABORATORIES: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,
bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose
253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,
mag 1.7 , CK 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , INR 1.1. EKG
reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorly
flattened T waves , with T in 1 , L in 6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascularly , the patient was continued
on heparin and ruled out for MI by CKs. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal
LAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal right
PDA. His LIMA to the D2 and the LAD were patent , as was the SVG to
OM-1. The SVG to the RCA was 100% occluded. A stent was placed in
the native mid-RCA and angioplasty was undertaken of the right PDA.
After the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he was
transitioned to Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for DVT prophylaxis. An
echo was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with
moderate reduction in function and EF of 35%. There is thinning
and hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,
as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. The RV
was normal. Pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrial
pressure. The patient continues to have episodes of epigastric
discomfort and belching , and his EKG revealed only nonspecific T
wave changes. He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise
treadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his
troponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having
some mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA that
had been angioplastied during cath. Recath was thought to be low
yield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the
interventional Cardiology Service. His medical regimen was
maximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates.
His cardiac enzymes trended down to a CK of 32 and a troponin of
0.33 upon discharge. He underwent submaximum ETT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/24</PHI> and
walked for nine minutes without EKG changes , but did experience
6/10 chest pain and some belching. The test was considered
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Of note , he
reached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80
during this submaximum stress test. The patient will be discharged
to home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Edison Nydia.</PHI> He will also have a follow-up stress test. He will see his
primary care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Josefina , Nicole</PHI> , for monitoring of his other
medical issues , including his diabetes. Discharge condition is
stable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and discharge
medications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one
tab sublingual a.q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , ramipril 5
mg p.o. q. day , Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day x 70 days , Plavix 75 mg

ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yarger Villareal</PHI> M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This 81-year-old female with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and
atrial fibrillation presents with nausea , vomiting , left lower
quadrant pain for one day and chronic nonbloody diarrhea on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/24/19.</PHI> The patient has had diarrhea for years , but this
episode was more severe and it was accompanied by nausea and
vomiting. Upon evaluation , she was found to have heme negative
stool. An abdominal CT showed a focal segment of colitis at the
splenic flexure with significant atheromatous disease of the SMA.
Findings were worrisome for mesenteric ischemia. As part of her
preoperative evaluation , she underwent a stress MIBI which showed
anterolateral , apical , and inferoposterior ischemia consistent with
three-vessel disease or left main disease. She does report
intermittent chest pressure and shortness of breath at rest and
with mild exertion over the past few years , increasing in the last three
months. She also reports two-pillow orthopnea and PMD. Given
these findings , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/30/19</PHI> as well as evaluation for celiac , SMA and IMA.
Catheterization showed 40% left main lesion. Otherwise , patent
coronary artery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 5.7 in <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/2919</PHI> ,
hypertension , question of COPD , depression , coronary artery
disease with an echo showing an EF of 45% on baseline inferior
hypokinesis.
MEDICATIONS:
Lasix , atenolol , bupropion , Fosamax , metformin , and lisinopril.
She has no known drug allergies.
On physical exam , the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of
72 , blood pressure of 132/61 , respiratory rate 20 , with an O2
saturation of 93% on room air. Cardiovascular exam was
remarkable for a regular heart rate with a normal S1 and S2.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam was
remarkable for quiet by all sounds. No tenderness and no
distention. Extremities had no edema , 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.
Abdominal angiography showed patent celiac SMA and IMA.
There was enhanced vascularity in the definitive or sliding
flexure but no embolic or angiographic cut off. The patient was
treated with NG tube to suction which improved his symptoms
although she cotinued to have.
LAB DATA: Remarkable for negative cardiac enzymes x3. Calcium
and magnesium , and potassium were repleted as needed. EKG was
unchanged with normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
Remainder of hospital course:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was started on mild Lasix diuresis for
shortness of breath with slight improvement in symptoms.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fracture of 50% with thick
aortic valve , thick mitral valve with trace MR , trace TR and
hypokinesis. There is severe baseline anteroseptal
distal-lateral apical hypokinesis and base posterior wall is
mildly hyperkinetic. Compared to report from <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/2919</PHI> , LV
function appeared slightly worse. She was continued on aspirin ,
ACE inhibitor , beta-blocker , statin. She was mainly in normal
sinus rhythm but due to recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular rate , she remained under rate control with
beta-blockers.
2. GI: The patient was n.p.o. with an NG tube to suction for the
first several days of her admission with resolution of nausea and
vomiting with continued diarrhea. Her diet was advanced to
clears and then a low-residue diet , which she tolerated
well. Her workup for chronic diarrhea included C. diff. , stool
cultures , fecal leukocytes , fecal fat , TSH , ESR , ANA , which were
all negative. Celiac sprue serologies were also sent and were
pending upon discharge. At this point , GI was consulted and the
patient underwent a colonoscopy and EGD. Colonoscopy showed
diverticula in the rectus sigmoid. There is overlying erythema
over the splenic flexure with shallow erosions suggestive of
ischemic colitis. Random biopsies were taken to rule out
microscopic colitis. EGD was unremarkable. Biopsies were
obtained and are pending to rule out H. pylori. Colonoscopy and
EGD biopsies should be followed up as an outpatient. Likely
etiology secondary to microscopic ischemia secondary to
malabsorption of celiac sprue.
:3. Infectious diseases: She completed a six-day course of
ampicillin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/30/19</PHI> , the patient
remained C. diff negative during the hospitalization.
4. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath likely secondary to pulmonary
process or underlying pulmonary disease in light of normal heart
function which should be followed up as an outpatient.
5. Endocrine: Metformin was held during the hospitalization
secondary to contrast administration. She remained on a regular
insulin sliding scale with adequate blood sugar control.
6. Renal: The patient was hydrated , pre and post di-loads with
unremarkable course of renal function.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on subcu heparin and
Pepcid.
The patient was stable , tolerating p.o. intake and p.o. meds.
She was discharged to rehab and will follow up with her primary
care physician and with cardiology and GI.

IMPRESSION: 58yo M s/p cardiac transplant c/b allograft vasculopathy ,
recent admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10</PHI> for pulmonary hemorrhage/PNA admitted with
increased SOB and hemoptysis. Likely CHF exacerbation +/- ILD +/- PNA
( CAP , atypicals , TB , PCP , fungal ). Patient's shortness of breath responded
to diuresis , and his symptoms improved. However bronchoscopy revealed
RML fresh blood , and CT chest is concerning for RML mass. Will need
follow up with pulmonary which is already arranged.
1. ) CV: No evidence of ischemia. Patient continued outpatient ASA ,
bblocker , statin , plavix. H/o cardiac transplant. Cyclosporine level on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3/10</PHI> was 152. His cyclosporine was increased during admission to 100mg po
BID. His sirolimus was discontinued.
PUMP- He was intially volume overloaded on exam. BNP on admission was 674.
He was diuresed with lasix 40mg po BID , and will be discharged on lasix
40mg po daily. Also given potassium 10meq a day , will need lytes
followed. His HCTZ was discontinued. Weight on day of discharge was
62.2kg. BP control with home regimen of dilt , lopressor , cadura.
2. ) PULM: Pulmonary was consulted. CT was negative for PE. He had a
bronchoscopy which was described above ( fresh blood oozing from RML ). BAL
was sent for multiple studies. PCP was negative , influenza negative , adeno
negative , viral studies , cultures , and cytology are pending at this time.
Galact Ag was negative. GBM antibody was negative. ANCA is pending.
Bronchoscopy and chest CT were concerning for RML mass. He will follow up
with a PET CT and Pulmonary appointment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/2/22.</PHI> Allergy was consulted
re whether his symptoms could be an allergic pneumonitis ( given history of
ASA allergy , an previous desensitization , and they felt it was unlikely.
Rheumatology was consulted re possible vasculitis given new proteinuria -
thought unlikely although final consult recommendations were pending at
time of discharge. He will be discharged on oxygen given desat to 87% on
RA with ambulation. He will be treated empirically with levofloxacin x 14

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> is a 42-year-old man with
history of diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
left Charcot foot complicated by recurrent cellulitis , who
presented with left lower leg swelling , erythema , and pain. The
patient does not recall having fevers at home , however , notes
that he "get fevers all the time" so he feels that he may not
have noticed. He did report that he had a temperature to about
101 and hemodialysis prior to admission for which he received one
dose of vancomycin. He denied having any symptoms of headache ,
chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , joint aches or
rash. He did endorse feeling fatigued with little energy. The
patient was referred to the Emergency Department given his
temperature of 101 at hemodialysis.
The patient has a long history of pain in his left foot secondary
to Charcot joint and chronic recurrent cellulitis including a

the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/2920</PHI> , after returning from weekend away he had
severe exacerbation of the pain in his left foot with progressive
development of swelling on the bottom of his foot. At this time ,
he had extensive evaluation including an MRI of the foot and it
was felt that there was no evidence of osteomyelitis. His
antibiotics were discontinued at this time and he was discharged
to a nursing home for rehabilitation. He remained in the nursing
home from <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/2920</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/2921</PHI> and was discharged home two

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1 ) ID-Given his presentation of L lower leg swelling and
erythema , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> was started on Vancomycin and Unasyn in the
emergency department. An X-ray of his L foot revealed significant
fragmentation and erosion of the tarsal/metatarsal bases and
focal soft tissue abnormality in the plantar region concerning
for abscess formation and possible osteomyelitis in the setting
of known Charcot arthropathy as well as diffuse soft tissue
swelling extending along the calf. Given these findings , he was
ordered for an MRI. With his MRI pending and his L leg looking
somewhat improved , his Unasyn was discontinued on HD 3 and he was
started on Augmentin and his Vancomycin was continued given his
history of MRSA cellulitis in the past. He spiked a fever on HD 3
and again on HD 4. On HD 5 , he had an MRI under conscious
sedation ( was attempted prior to this , but pt unable to
tolerate ). MRI revealed 4 cm fluid pocket in the subcutaneous
tissue of the plantar aspect of the left foot demonstrating
communication with the medial tendon sheaths and the ankle joint
with findings worrisome for abscess and osteomyelitis of at least
the medial malleolus , calcaneus , cuboid and talus. Infectious
disease was consulted and he was started on IV Levofloxacin and
IV Flagyl to cover gram negatives and anaerobes respectively and
his vancomycin continued to be dosed for level less than 20.
Orthopedics was consulted who performed an arthrocentesis of his
ankle as well as an arthrocentesis of the fluid collection at the
bottom of his foot. Ankle aspirate gram stain was negative , but
with 4+ polys. Fluid differential revealed &gt;160 , 000 WBCs. In
consultation with infectious disease , orthopedics , and the
patient , it was decided that the best course of action would be a
L below knee amputation given the extent of the infection. This
was performed on HD 8 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hunter.</PHI> He did have fever spikes
again on HD 8-9 and had repeat blood cultures which were
negative. An echocardiogram was performed on HD 12. While he did
have a tiny focal thickening of the aortic cusp , this was
reviewed with Cardiology and infectious disease and was not
though to represent a vegetation. He was afebrile x &gt;48 hours
prior to discharge. His surgical pathology returned with clean
margins on day of discharge , and as per ID consult service , he
does not need further antibiotics. He should have dry sterile
dressing changes to his residual limb daily. He may need an extra
dose of pain medication prior to this. If there is any evidence
of erythema or drainage , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hunter.</PHI> 's office should be
contacted at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">580-338-3609.</PHI>
2 ) Renal-Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> was on the renal service and had hemodialysis
3 times a week ( M/W/F ) without complication. Of note , he is
awaiting kidney transplant from his sister and is followed by Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yelle Dale</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">IJC</PHI> .
3 ) Heme-Mr <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> was on coumadin as an outpatient. We obtained
his hospital records from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VIH</PHI> and a vascular study from <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/09</PHI>
showed evidence of a DVT in the L internal jugular vein from
<PHI TYPE="DATE">11/09.</PHI> The details surrounding this DVT are not documented ,
however Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> reports that his vascular surgeon told him
that he should remain on Coumadin. His coumadin was held prior to
going to the OR and he was placed on a heparin drip. His coumadin
was restarted after his BKA and he was bridged with heparin with
a goal PTT of 60-80. Prior to discharge , he PTT was 103 and his
heparin drip was decreased from 2100 to 1950units per hours. He
should have a repeat PTT checked on transfer to his acute
rehabilitation center with goal PTT 60-80. INR on day of
discharge was 1.8 , 1.6 day prior to discharge. His heparin drip
can be discontinued once his INR is therapeutic with goal of 2-3.
His INR will need to be followed every 2-3 days until stable off
of levofloxacin.
4 ) CV
Ischemia-Mr <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> was on gemfibrozil 600mg bid and lipitor 80mg
as an outpatient. His lipid panel was checked: TC 140 , TG 151 ,
LDL 82 , HDL 28. Given that his LDL was 82 and the risk of
rhabdomylosis on high dose gemfibrozil and lipitor , his lipitor
was decreased to 20mg. He should have a repeat lipid panel in 4-6
weeks. He was also started on low dose b-blocker to reduce
perioperative MI risk prior to his surgery. He reported that he
is not on aspirin given that he has had b/l vitrectomies and his
doctor felt that the risk of bleeding was too high. This can be
readdressed as an outpatient.
Pump-Pt had elevated systolic blood pressures to the 160s in the
beginning of his stay. He was started on lisinopril which was
uptitrated to 5mg and also lopressor.
Rhtyhm-He had no evidence of arrythmias.
5 ) Endocrine-Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> has DM which was diagnosed at age 23. It
is unclear if he has type I or II as he reported that he was told
he has Type I , but had a three year stint after diagnosis where
he was not on insulin. His FS on admission were elevated , likely
secondary to his infection and his lantus was uptitrated. He was
also started on prandial coverage. Prior to discharge , he was his
home dose of Lantus as well as Aspart with meals. He reported
that he already has an outpatient endocrinologist with whom he
will follow up. An HgA1c was 8.4.
6 ) Pain-Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> had significant post operative pain which
seemed to be mostly phantom limb pain. The acute pain service was
consulted and he was initially placed on a ketamine drip and
Fentanyl PCA. His fentanyl PCA and ketamine drip were
discontinued and he was started on oxycontin 80mg tid with
oxycodone for breakthrough pain. He was also started on Lyrica
for neuropathic pain. He was comfortable prior to discharge on
this current regimen. As his pain improves , he pain regimen
should be decreased.
7 ) Psychiatry-After learning that he would likely receive a
transplant from his sister , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">JTGOTD</PHI> reports that he has had
significant anxiety prior to going for dialysis. Psychiatry
service was consulted who recommended low dose Ativan prior to
him going to dialysis.

IDENTIFICATION: This is a 58-year-old gentleman admitted for an
EPS study.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old white male
status post aortic root homograft in
1995 for aortic insufficiency secondary to a bicuspid aorta. The
patient was doing very well. He was followed biannually by Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Johnny , Nicholson R.</PHI> Recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
65% with the graft intact. The patient noted several episodes of
light-headedness over the last several weeks. Most recently while
playing tennis he collapsed; however , denied loss of consciousness.
He denied palpitations. The patient was seen today in Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jake</PHI> clinic where he had a ETT test which was stopped
secondary to runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Polio in 1955 , aortic valve root homograft
in 1999.
MEDICATIONS: Cardizem CD 240 milligrams q.d. , Vasotec 5 milligrams
b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco and alcohol. He is married with
two children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for arrhythmias.
ALLERGIES: None.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.9 , heart rate 87 , blood
pressure 146/96 , saturating at 96% on room
air. In general , obese male in no acute distress. HEENT: Moist
mucous membranes. There is a left facial droop with decreased
muscle tone. Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , obese. Normal bowel sounds. Extremities: No
edema. Neurologic: Alert and oriented times three. Cranial
nerves II-XII grossly intact.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. QT intervals normal.
LABORATORY: Sodium 141 , creatinine 1.0 , white count 8.6 , platelet
count 186 , 000. His echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1999
showed an ejection fraction of 65% , normal homograft function. His
Holter monitor showed sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs and some
couplets. His ETT done in clinic showed he did eight minutes and
33 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol. He had three beats of
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , asymptomatic. Peak heart rate
was 150 , peak blood pressure 182 systolic.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service. His hypertensive medications were
continued. The patient had a repeat echocardiogram confirming that
he had normal valve function. The patient's echocardiogram showed
an ejection fraction around 50% which revealed AI , no valve
dysfunction. His QT interval remained normal on his EKG. The
patient underwent both a left heart catheterization to rule out
significant coronary artery disease as well as an EP study on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17/14.</PHI> The patient's catheterization showed normal vessels ,
ejection fraction of 55%. His EP study showed normal AV function ,
no inducible SVT. Repeated , new runs of nonsustained monomorphic
as well as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , some observed on
the ETT test. The recommendations were to start a betablocker and
place an ICD. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 19</PHI> , 1999 , the patient had an ICD placed
without any complications. The patient remained asymptomatic
during his hospital stay. He had no episodes of syncope.

CHOLESTEROLEMIA; 3 ) OBESITY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vicenta</PHI> is a 45 year old gentle-
man with a long history of coronary
artery disease , the first admission to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI>
due to myocardial infarction was <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 2nd</PHI> , 1988. Coronary
angiography in 1988 revealed three vessel coronary artery disease
with ejection fraction of 45%. The next hospitalization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> in 1993 due to syncopal episode. Since the last
admission , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vicenta</PHI> was doing well , essentially the same level
of symptoms. Objectively , however , there was evidence of
significant progression of coronary disease with Thallium images
suggestive of severe multivessel coronary artery disease and
developed LV dysfunction. Recent admission to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> for coronary artery catheterization and eventual
myocardial revascularization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 55 year old man , overweight. Blood
pressure 122/80 , heart rate 56 , regular.
Weight 204. Lungs clear. Jugular venous pressure not elevated at
30 degrees. Hepatojugular reflex is negative. Carotid upstroke
normal without bruits. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs. Abdomen
obese , but otherwise benign. Peripheral pulses are intact
throughout. No pitting edema.
LABORATORY VALUES: White count 7 , 000 , hematocrit 42% ,
184 platelets. BUN 24 , creatinine
1.1 , 1.0 , glucose 101 and sodium 139 , potassium 4.4. PT 12.9 , PTT
25.4 , INR 1.2. EKG - sinus bradycardia and inferior myocardial
infarction. Cardiac catheterization report from the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of July</PHI> ,
1995 revealed coronary artery disease with total occlusion of the
left anterior descending artery in its proximal portion , left
circumflex artery is small , non dominant and large obtuse marginal
branch and the right coronary artery totally occluded in its mid
portion. The left ventriculogram revealed markedly enlarged
ventricle with inferior hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
Calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 46%.
OPERATION: Coronary bypass to anterior
descending and posterior descending
arteries on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">15th of July</PHI> , 1995 , surgeon was Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yuan Y. Hines , Yeates.</PHI>
POSTOPERATIVE COURSE: The patient was extubated on the
first postoperative day and
transferred to the ward. Further postoperative course was
uneventful so the patient could be discharged in good postoperative
condition on the fifth ( 5th ) postoperative day.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old lady with
known history of coronary artery
disease , who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x three in
1989 , with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal , and
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. In the last
four months , she experienced chest tightness and dyspnea on
exertion , and during the last month , her fatigue was extreme. The
patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/26/11</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Natalie Umstead Clinic</PHI> where an
echocardiogram revealed low-normal ejection fraction with severe
aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency. Aortic valve area
was calculated on 0.8 square centimeters. Cardiac catheterization ,
performed in the same hospital , revealed an ejection fraction of
66% with normal pulmonary artery pressures , aortic valve area of
0.6 square centimeters , and gradient across the valve of 44 mm
of Hg. Native coronary artery disease showed 70% stenosis of the
left main , occluded left anterior descending , 50% stenosis of the
obtuse marginal , and 70% stenosis of the right coronary arteries.
The graft to the left anterior descending and to to the OM1 were
patent. The saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was
occluded.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/16/2914</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Atrial flutter. 2. Congestive heart
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure
and history of atrial flutter in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1998. The patient was
admitted to Cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter and
worsening congestive heart failure. The patient initially
presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1998 with
acute shortness of breath and atrial flutter. Chest x-ray at that
time showed congestive heart failure. The patient was initially
rate controlled with Verapamil and Digoxin and converted to normal
sinus rhythm. However , on Digoxin , the patient developed
junctional tachycardia , which reverted back to normal sinus rhythm
after Digoxin was discontinued. Echocardiogram at that time showed
an ejection fraction of 35%. The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10-13-13</PHI>
in normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged on Lopressor ,
Verapamil , Aspirin , and Coumadin , which was stopped five months
ago. The patient did extremely well after discharge until about
five days ago when he ran out of his Atenolol , which he had not
taken since then. Over the past week , the patient had extreme
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion , which steadily worsened. Today ,
the patient was taking out the trash and experienced a few seconds
of chest heaviness on the left side , without any radiation. The
patient reported being short of breath , but had no other symptoms.
Upon trying to the mailbox , the patient was extremely short of
breath and fell to the ground , but had no loss of consciousness.
There was no warning or dizziness. The patient was brought to
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanbuskirk &Wiggins;Araceli/Dianne</PHI> Emergency Department. There , the patient was
noted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150. The patient was
given IV Lopressor , 5 mg , and his heart rate came down to 106.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A review of systems was positive for three
pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and increasing
lower extremity swelling over the past week. The patient denied
any fever , chills , night sweats , or change in bowel movements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history was significant for
high blood pressure , left ankle and left knee arthritis ,
questionable history of gout , gonococcal urethritis ,
diverticulosis , elevated cholesterol , and cardiomyopathy with
ejection fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1998.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS
ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was on
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day ,
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , which the patient self discontinued
five days prior to admission , Lisinopril 20 mg q. day , Aspirin ,
B12 , Folate , and Multivitamins. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's
social history was significant for tobacco , one pack per day for
forty years. The patient quit in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1998. Alcohol was
significant for two to three drinks per day , with none since
<PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1998. There was no history of drug use. The patient
lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</PHI> alone. The patient is a retired social worker.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's family history was significant for a
mother with a myocardial infarction at 60 , brother with myocardial
infarction at 54 , and father who is deceased from cerebrovascular
accident.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was
afebrile. The heart rate was 115 , blood
pressure 150/100 , and saturation 95% on 2 liters. In general , the
patient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress. HEENT
revealed the patient to be normocephalic , atraumatic. The pupils
were equal , round and reactive to light. The extraocular movements
were intact. The oropharynx was moist. The neck was supple
without bruits. The chest was clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a 1/6 holosystolic murmur. The
patient was in atrial flutter. The abdominal examination was
benign. The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There was no
clubbing or cyanosis. Electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial
flutter at rate of 50 , as well as left axis deviation , right bundle
branch block , left ventricular hypertrophy with QRS widening , old
inferior myocardial infarction , and right bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion ,
consistent with congestive heart failure , and bilateral pleural
effusions.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission showed sodium 146 ,
potassium 4.4 , creatinine 1.2 , white blood cell
count 6.7 , hematocrit 42.5 , CK 95 , and troponin 0.05.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology floor
for treatment of atrial flutter and congestive
heart failure. The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. It was felt that the patient's worsening congestive
heart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. The patient was
started on Lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker.
However , the patient remained in atrial flutter with poor rate
control. Echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-11</PHI> showed an ejection fraction of
30-35% with global hypokinesis. Of note , also , the patient's
ventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistent
with possible infiltrative disease. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-12-14</PHI> , the patient
underwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still in
atrial flutter and was not having good rate control. The patient
was successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm
afterwards. However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-13</PHI> , the patient was still significantly
short of breath and hypoxic. This was felt probably likely
secondary to fluid overload , and the patient was started on Lasix.
However , the patient underwent a VQ scan and was ruled out for
pulmonary embolism. The patient did well and , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-15</PHI> , the patient
experienced bilateral lip swelling , consistent with angioedema.
The patient's Lasix and Captopril were discontinued , as it was
unclear which agent had caused this , however , it was most likely
the Captopril. This responded well to Benadryl. The patient was
started on ethacrynic acid and Hydralazine for diuresis and
afterload reduction. The patient did well on this regimen. On
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7-16</PHI> , the patient was discharged home in stable condition. The
patient was in sinus rhythm and was satting well on room air.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg
inhaled q. 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing , Enteric coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. q. day , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , Edecrin 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day , Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day , and
Benadryl 50 mg p.o. q. 6 hours as needed for lip swelling.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">CWUESG</PHI>

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jeanine Nellie Hillary</PHI> MD
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old male
who was being worked up for other surgery and during preoperative
testing he was noted to have an abnormal EKG. This prompted a
cardiac stress test , which was abnormal. He therefore received
additional cardiac workup and was found to have coronary artery
disease. He does have a history of atrial fibrillation in the
past , but reports that he has not had any symptoms prior to his
initially planned shoulder surgery. He therefore presented for
CABG rather than having shoulder surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. COPD.
5. BPH.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Nephrolithiasis.
8. Impotence.
9. Bursitis.
10. Non-allergic rhinitis.
11. History of hepatitis in 1960.
12. Constipation.
13. Right-sided renal artery stenosis.
14. Renal insufficiency.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Left rotator cuff repair in 1991.
2. Tonsillectomy.
3. Thumb surgery in childhood.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking. He also
drinks approximately 2 beers per month.
ALLERGIES: Procainamide , which causes diarrhea and arthralgia ,
also verapamil , which can cause constipation.
MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION:
1. Toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Propafenone 150 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Rhinocort Aqua 32 mcg q.d.
6. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , height 5 feet 10 inches ,
weight 102 kg , heart rate of 54 , blood pressure 130/88 in the
right arm and 142/88 in the left arm. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact.
Mucous membranes are moist. Oropharynx is clear. There are no
carotid bruits. Dentition is without evidence of infection.
Chest is free of incisions. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm. There are no murmurs. Pulses: Carotid , radial ,
femoral , dorsalis pedis , and posterior tibialis pulses are all 2+
bilaterally. Allen's test in the left upper extremity was normal
with using a pulse oximeter. Respiratory: The patient has clear
breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: There are no incisions.
Abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds. Extremities: Are free of scarring , varicosities
or edema. Neurologic: The patient is alert and oriented. He
has no focal deficits.
LABS UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 178 , magnesium 2 ,
white count 8 , hematocrit 38.5 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets 163 ,
PT 16 , INR 1.3 , PTT 34.9. Urinalysis is normal. Cardiac
catheterization done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/16/19</PHI> revealed a 90% ostial LAD
lesion , 70% ostial ramus , 90% mid D1 , 80% ostial D3 , 75% proximal
circumflex , 50% ostial RCA , 90% proximal PDA. There was right
dominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. He
had an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to hospital on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">04/25/19</PHI> and was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/26/19</PHI> where he
received a five-vessel CABG in which the left internal mammary
artery was sewn to the LAD. Saphenous vein graft 1 to first
diagonal artery. Right internal mammary artery was sewn to the
ramus. The left radial artery was harvested and sewn to LVB2 and
LVB1. Bypass time was 159 minutes. Cross clamp time 111
minutes. Postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensive
care unit where he was hemodynamically stable. He was rapidly
weaned of the ventilator without problems. He did develop a bout
of rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two days
postoperatively. This was treated by restarting the patient's
propafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrial
fibrillation. The patient's other primary issue postoperatively
while in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , near
anuria. A renal consult was obtained at this time. He did
receive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to be
essentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. He was started
on low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back to
his baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 ,
he began to make adequate amounts of urine. It was therefore
determined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependent
with him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. He remained
hemodynamically stable. He did have some constipation , which was
treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequently
resolved. He will be transferred out to the cardiac step-down
unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/2/19.</PHI>
The remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at the
time of discharge.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/12/2906</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old Oriental male
with three vessel coronary artery
disease awaiting surgical evaluation. The initial onset of angina
was in 1972. He had a positive ETT with ST depressions in V5 and
V6. He had only rare angina since then treated with sublingual
nitroglycerin or rest. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/19/06</PHI> , he had a positive ETT which was
stopped secondary to chest pain. The EKG showed 2 mm ST
depressions in two , three , F and V4 through V6. He was encouraged
to have a cardiac catheterization , but he was reluctant to do this.
He has good exercise tolerance; takes long walks with his wife
without chest pain and swims for an hour a day. He had a cardiac
catheterization on the day of admission which showed 70% left main ,
100% left circumflex , 100% RCA and 90% LAD. PAST HISTORY:
Significant for GI bleed in the past. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol; Persantine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant man in no acute
distress. The HEENT exam was benign. The
neck was supple and nontender. The lungs were clear. The heart
exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm. Pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruits. The neuro exam was nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT: 58-year-old Oriental male with unimpressive symptoms
but strongly positive ETT and severe three vessel coronary artery
disease including left main at catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by cardiac surgery and
evaluated. He was taken to the operating room on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3/5/06.</PHI> He had a coronary artery bypass graft times four with a
LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein grafts to the diagonal , marginal
and PDA. Postoperatively he did very well with the exception of
24-48 hours of severe confusion and agitation after extubation
requiring four point restraints and Haldol. He gradually resolved
this by postop day #3 and began gently diuresing. His wound had
continuous oozing from the left thigh with no erythema or sign of
infection. This was continued on dressing changes.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged uneventfully on postop day #7 with
VNA follow up for his wound. FOLLOW UP will be with
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yuan Y. Hines , Yeates.</PHI> in three weeks.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/3/2906</PHI>
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Rule out myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 39-year-old white male with
multiple risk factors for coronary
artery disease , including sex , weight , hypertension , smoking ,
positive family history and cholesterol. He had a four month
history of exercise induced crescendo angina with palpitations and
had an exercise thallium study done on the day of admission. The
results of this showed questionable evidence of ischemia. He was
able to exercise for nine minutes and 16 seconds with a heart rate
of 160 and a blood pressure of 166/84. His test was stopped for
mild chest pain of 3/10 and fatigue. There was no EKG changes
except for some APCs , PVCs and upsloping ST changes. A thallium
scan showed a fixed inferior defect and anterior redistribution on
a later scan; this was on a preliminary reading. The final reading
is pending at this time. After the study , he continued to have
waxing and waning episodes of chest pressure that were not
completely relieved with nitroglycerin. In the emergency room , he
was treated with metoprolol , sublingual nitroglycerin , heparin
drip and aspirin. ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a well appearing anxious man in no
apparent distress. The HEENT exam was
unremarkable. The neck was supple with a 0.5 cm nodule in the left
upper pole of the thyroid that is moveable and nontender. The
cardiovascular exam revealed no extra heart sounds or murmurs. The
lungs were clear. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The
extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema. He had good
distal pulses and no bruits in the femoral arteries post
catheterization. The wound was clean.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Cholesterol 285; serial CKs 112 , 81 and
66; T-3 149; T-4 6.6; TSH 1.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He continued to have chest pain during the
evening with normal EKGs unchanged from
admission. Because of the continued nature of the pain , he was
placed on a nitroglycerin drip and given morphine sulfate which
controlled the pain. On the second hospital day he had a cardiac
catheterization of both sides of the heart which showed normal LV
function and normal coronaries per the cardiology note. He has
been free of chest pain since the procedure and has been taken off
of all of his medications.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged in good condition. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. p.r.n. pain. FOLLOW
UP will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cristina , Jasper Nola</PHI> , his cardiologist. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">RXHLSG</PHI> has
been informed of the findings on cardiac catheterization , and the
patient has been instructed to call her after his meeting with the
cardiologist. He has also been advised to lose some weight and to
modify his diet in order to correct his hypercholesterolemia. Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">RXHLSG</PHI> will follow up on the thyroid nodule and the high
cholesterol.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Bacteremia , hypotension , coronary artery
disease , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chills/hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hanson</PHI> is a pleasant
69-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD , PVD , diabetes who
presents with 3 days of feeling poorly. He initially had lower
abdominal pain <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/25/2922.</PHI> He went to see his primary care
doctor on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/26/2922</PHI> where labs were drawn. He had one episode
of emesis ( watery and nonbilious ). On the day of admission , he
woke up with chills and called his PCP who recommended he go to
the ED for further evaluations.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Remarkable for a poor appetite. He denied
any shortness of breath , cough , current abdominal pain , diarrhea ,
or dysuria. In the ED his temperature was 104.8 , his blood
pressure was 70/45 , with heart rate in the 120s. His exam was
also remarkable for altered mental status with confusion
regarding dates and requiring frequent reorientation. A central
line was placed and he was given vancomycin , levofloxacin , and
Flagyl prior to transfer to the MICU for further care.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes type 2 which has
been diet controlled , hypercholesterolemia , coronary artery
disease status post 4 vessel CABG in 2004 , EF of 35% ( per echo in
2004 ) , history of A-Fib on chronic Coumadin , a history of
peripheral vascular disease status post left popliteal bypass ,
bilateral ankle grafts , gallstones on right upper quadrant
ultrasound in <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/2921.</PHI>
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin , atenolol , lisinopril , Lasix ,
Zocor , digoxin , Cilostazol , multivitamins , Protonix , K-Dur ,
Ambien , lorazepam , and Coumadin.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes hives , Norvasc , Plavix ( GI upset ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission on transfer to floor after
MICU stabilization , temperature 97.9 , heart rate 99 , blood
pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 20 , sating 100% on 2 liters. In
general , he was awake and alert , and appropriately answering
questions. His HEENT exam was notable for upper dentures.
Otherwise , his oropharynx was clear. His neck was supple , a
right IJ was in place. He had no bruits. His lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally. His heart rate was tachycardic ,
irregularly irregular , without any murmurs. His abdomen was
soft , nontender , nondistended , with good bowel sounds with no
hepatosplenomegaly and a negative Murphy's sign. His extremities
had no edema. There were trace DP pulses. His bilateral
extremities were cool. His neuro exam , he was alert and oriented
x3. He was moving all extremities and his cranial nerves were
intact.
STUDIES/PROCEDURES:
Surgery: A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted and
failed. "White bile" drained from his gallbladder , his liver was
very friable. The surgeons aborted the procedure and recommended
medical therapy.
CT of Abdomen/Pelvis: Demonstrated ascending/transverse colitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cholecystitis/Bacteremia: The patient presented with septic
physiology with the source thought to be acute cholecystitis. He
was brought to the OR for laparoscopic cholecystectomy which was
aborted due to his liver disease causing his friable liver and
his high operative risk. The surgical team recommended medical
therapy. He improved markedly on Cipro/Flagyl and is planned for
a 2-week course at discharge. Due to his liver disease ,
hepatitis serologies were checked which did not reveal ongoing
infection. It is recommended that he follow up with a
gastroenterologist for further workup.
2. Cardiovascular ( Ischemia ): Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hanson</PHI> has a history of
CAD status post CABG with an episode of hypotension/sepsis. In
this setting , he had an NSTEMI with troponin peaking at 0.95. He
is continued on his aspirin and his statin.
3. Cardiovascular ( Pump ): Given his septic presentation , his
antihypertensives were initially held. They were restarted 3
days prior to discharge , and Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hanson</PHI> had pressures in the
90s but was asymptomatic with these pressures. It was thought
that he was clinically dry. So , Lasix was held at discharge with
the plan to restart them with any weight gain ( the patient weighs
himself daily ) , shortness of breath as advised by his cardiac
nurse ( who will see early on the week of discharge ).
4. Cardiovascular ( Rhythm ): Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hanson</PHI> has a history of
A-Fib on Coumadin , digoxin , and atenolol at home. He will be
discharged on Coumadin/digoxin/Lopressor given his marginal blood
pressures with low-dose beta blockade.
5. Heme: The patient's INR increased to 3.9 at the time of
discharge ( likely secondary to Cipro and Coumadin interaction ).
This was discussed with the patient's <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cummings Kathrine Ivette Wilhemina , Isenberg</PHI> anticoagulation
nurse and plans were made to hold Coumadin for 3 days' time and
recheck it on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/06/2922.</PHI>
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , ciprofloxacin 250 mg
every 12 hours , digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. twice
daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg at bedtime , Maalox p.r.n. upset stomach ,
Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. , omeprazole 40 mg
b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , Zocor 40 mg nightly ,
multivitamin one tablet daily.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/4/22.</PHI> Her exam
was notable for significant lower extremity edema with probable
lower extremity cellulitis on the left as well as pulmonary
wheezing. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
for dyspnea and underwent transthoracic echocardiogram , which
revealed ejection fraction of 40% to 45% and a stable mitral
valve. The patient was started on a Lasix drip and Diuril with
improvement of symptoms. She was also started on antibiotics for
coverage of possible lower extremity cellulitis. The Pulmonary
team was consulted , as the patient has history of COPD and they
recommended regimen of Advair and steroid
taper for her COPD. She was empirically covered for pneumonia
with levofloxacin and Flagyl and continued to diurese well on a
Lasix drip. She was transferred to the Step-Down Unit the
following day. Her preadmission cardiac meds as well as her
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation were restarted. The patient required ongoing
aggressive diuresis to eventually achieve a fluid balance of is
negative 1 liter daily. With diuresis , the patient complained of
postural dizziness , lightheadedness and nausea. Liver function
tests as well as amylase and lipase were checked and noted to be
normal. KUB was without evidence of
small-bowel obstruction or perforation , and with stool throughout the colon.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/16/2910</PHI>
DIAGNOSIS: MORBID OBESITY
PROCEDURE: Panniculectomy
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 42 year old female nurse
chronically obese , whose last weight
two weeks ago was 430 pounds , after a loss of 90 pounds since
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January.</PHI> The patient's mobility is limited to short walks around
the house and she has had some shortness of breath with exertion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for a congenital heart murmur
with major depression , diagnosed in 1990;
duodenal ulcer in 1972; diabetes mellitus , type II , diagnosed in
1995; status post laparotomy in 1974.
MEDICATIONS: Paxil , 60 mg P O q AM; Diabeta , 5 mg P O q AM;
Trazadone , 100 mg q h.s.; Ultram , 100 mg q 4-6 hours
prn; Reglan , 10 mg q 6 hours prn nausea; Bactroban ointment b.i.d.;
Lotrisone cream b.i.d. topically; Afrin nasal spray q 12 hours PRN;
Proventil inhalers , two puffs PRN.
ALLERGIES: To Penicillin , which produces a rash; Corticosteroids
Phenothiazine and aspirin.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs on admission , temperature 99 , pulse 80 ,
respirations 20 , blood pressure 102/70; height 4
feet , 11 inches; weight 430 pounds. Physical exam in general - this
is a massively obese woman lying down in no apparent distress. Her
skin is warm and dry. Her HEENT is benign. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart - normal S1 , normal S2 and a
regular rate and rhythm and without any appreciable murmur at this
time. Abdomen - morbidly obese , with a pannus hanging down to
below the knee level , it is soft , non tender and with difficulty
auscultating bowel sounds. Neurologically , she is alert and
oriented x 3 with no focal deficits. Extremities - she is able to
stand on her feet with no motor or sensory deficits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/07/10</PHI> with concern
for her being at high risk of skin breakdown and
infection. Plans were made for panniculectomy , however , prior to
this procedure , she was admitted for IV Ancef t.i.d.; Hibiclenz
showers and sub-q Heparin. Preoperatively , her pulmonary function
was assessed and found to have an FEV-1 of 53% of predicted; FVC of
57% of predicted and an FEV-1/FVC of 93% of predicted. Chest x-ray
showed no active cardiopulmonary disease and an EKG showed a normal
sinus rhythm with a non specific T wave abnormality without change
since 1994. Her hematocrit preoperatively was 39.8 and her white
count was 9. A pulmonary consultation was also obtained because of
concern about her pulmonary status for the operation. On their
recommendation , the patient was treated with Azmacort inhalers ,
Albuterol nebulizer , and aggressive chest PT. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10/10</PHI> , the
patient was taken to the operating room where a panniculectomy was
performed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Travis.</PHI> , without any complications.
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</PHI> ICU , where
she continued to be intubated and on ventilatory support. On
postoperative day one , the patient was successfully extubated in
the morning , had 100% saturation on 40% face mask and she was
mobilized early with aggressive chest PT and deep breathing
encouragement stopped. The patient received two ( 2 ) units of
autologous red blood cells; after which her hematocrit was 32%.
Postoperative day two , the patient was found to have a hematocrit
down to 25.2 , likely due to re-equilibration and over the next two
days received two ( 2 ) units of blood with a hematocrit reaching
29%. Though she complained of light headiness prior to the
transfusion , afterwards she was up and walking without difficulty.
From postoperative day two , the patient was saturating at greater
than 93% on room air; had a wound that was clean and dry and intact
with serosanguineous drainage in the Jackson-Pratt drains and
showed no evidence of cellulitis , purulent drainage or fever , on IV
Ancef. On postoperative day five , two of the four Jackson-Pratt
drains were removed after their output fell below 30 ccs per day
and the patient was discharged in good condition on postoperative
day six with plans for home visiting nurse for dressing changes
daily and P O Keflex while two Jackson-Pratt drains were in. The
patient will be following up in outpatient clinic with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Travis.</PHI>
in one ( 1 ) week.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Keflex , 500 mg P O q.i.d.; 2 ) Percocet
one to two P O q 4 hours prn pain; 3 )
Lotrisone topically , TP b.i.d.; 4 ) Paxil , 60 mg P O q AM; 5 )

ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Non-ST elevation MI.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: Thromboembolic coronary artery occlusion ,
rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve replacement , aortic valve
replacement with St. Jude's valve , status post tricuspid repair ,
CHF , type II diabetes , atrial fibrillation , esophageal ulcer ,
osteoporosis.
In brief , Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">MLGWI</PHI> is a 63-year-old Hindi speaking woman with
CAD , rheumatic heart disease , status post mitral valve
replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , diabetes type II ,
history of subacute bacterial endocarditis transferred from
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Padilla Clinic</PHI> with a troponin of 64. She had presented with
several days of neck and back pain and some vague mild left sided
chest pain. No shortness of breath and diaphoresis. No cough.
At <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Padilla Clinic</PHI> , EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with
some 1-2 mm depressions in V2 through V5. There was a question
of dig effect. Her chest x-ray demonstrated a right lower lobe
infiltrate and patient was given aspirin , Lovenox and transferred
to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> for catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD , rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve
replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , SBE , diabetes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient presented again with a non-ST
elevation MI with elevated troponin. The patient had had a
negative catheterization just two years ago and it was unclear
whether or not her troponin leak was from epicardial coronary
artery disease or from another source such as pericarditis or
erosion from endocarditis into her myocardium. Also , given the
back pain , there was a concern for aortic dissection and a chest
CT was done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/14/19</PHI> which showed no aortic dissection. She
was continued on heparin , Plavix , aspirin , and beta-blocker and
will be restarted on her ACE inhibitor , was not restarted in
hospital , by her PCP. Given her continued neck pain with endemic
ST changes which included depressions in V2 through V5 , and her
substantial elevation in her troponin I to a peak of 64 , a
catheterization was done that demonstrated thrombosis on OM2 at
the ostia which was thought to be embolic. All her other
coronary arteries appeared normal , so this 100% lesion was
angioplastied to 50% residual. Post procedure course was
complicated by pulmonary edema with rising O2 requirement. She
diuresed well with improvement to room air , satting 100%. She
again had neck pain in V2 through V5 depressions on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/19</PHI> , just
three days after the catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16.</PHI> This was
medically managed because the dynamic changes did not return and
thought to be left over plaque from the last lesion. The patient
had been stable for about one week before discharge without any
complaints of neck pain whatsoever and her troponins had trended
down significantly during this event. The patient had not
complained of any symptoms while walking.
Pump-wise , her echo showed an EF of 60% with preserved LV and RV
function. Her old RVSP increased roughly to 65 , possible
increase in mitral gradient. The patient had had RVSP before and
it had been increased at roughly to 55 mmHg. Possible increase
in mitral gradient and no veg on her echo though it was tough to
evaluate given her artificial valve. The patient then had a TEE
which was negative for vegetation or thrombus. It was thought
that the thrombus she had already thrown to her OM2 would most
likely be the thrombus that she had had and there was none left
on the valves. For that reason , patient was volume overloaded
and was diuresed on torsemide 100 PO b.i.d. which seems to be a
good regimen for her as far as her dry weights seem to be around
50 kilos , maybe even 48 kilos , and she should have daily weights
checked.
Rhythm-wise , the patient had A. fib. She was on tele and no
events and she is being anticoagulated both for her valve and for
her A. fib.
ID-wise , she had increased white blood cell count and a left
shift with one band , the right lower lobe infiltrate and
completed a 7-day course of levo. Was afebrile throughout the
hospitalization and had negative blood cultures , and again the
negative TEE.
Heme-wise , her INR goal is now 3 to 4 , ideally 3 to 3.5 , and this
is essential. Patient will follow up with the Coumadin Clinic.
Her INR was 5.3 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/27/19.</PHI> She was treated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26/19.</PHI> She
had an INR of ??__?? She is to be drawn by the VNA the next day ,
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/28/19</PHI> , and they should call Coumadin Clinic with the result.
Given high INR , we held the Coumadin on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/27</PHI> and restarted dose
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/28</PHI> at a dose of 3 q.p.m.
Respiratory-wise , the patient finished levo for presumed
pneumonia and had no other respiratory problems. She did
complain sometimes of subjective shortness of breath , but her
oxygen saturation remained at 100% throughout the rest of the
hospitalization besides after the cath.
GI-wise , she is stable. She got some simethicone for gas and a
bowel regimen. She was doing well , but given her continued pain ,
GI and surgery consulted on her for a question of mesenteric
ischemia. A CT angiogram of the abdomen was performed with
negative workup for mesenteric ischemia. They thought that most
of her discomfort was due to constipation.
FEN-wise , we replaced her lytes. Also we put her on carnitine
for diet supplementation.
Renal-wise , the patient had increase in creatinine secondary to
the dye load from the cath and both her CT scans. The creatinine
was .9 on day of discharge. We held off on starting the ACE
because of this , but she should consider getting an ACE to add to
her regimen given her diabetes and recent MI. That should be
started as an outpatient.
Endocrine-wise , her diabetes is in really poor control. She had
sugars ranging from 40 to 400. We changed her regimen to Lantus
26 units q.p.m. along with novalog pre-meal with 16 before
breakfast and 8 of novalog before lunch and 8 of novalog before
dinner. Her sugars improved greatly , all in the 100s. She had
severe osteoporosis as well and vitamin C deficiency. Consider
starting Zometa as an outpatient per primary care doctor , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Olivo Nigel</PHI> Prophylaxis with heparin and Nexium.
DISPO: She refused rehab and wanted to go home with services and
she should get home PT and a home VNA. She is full code.
PLAN: Follow up with the Coumadin Clinic and get her blood drawn
every 2-3 days. The VNA should call <PHI TYPE="PHONE">516-620-4117</PHI> with the
results of her INR. In addition , her goal again is to have an
INR of 3-4. She should follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wendie Geraldo.</PHI> , her
cardiologist , in 1-2 weeks and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Olivo Nigel</PHI> will come to
see her on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/31</PHI> , 11:30 a.m. at her house. I also recommended
that patient not add salt to her diet and not drink fluids
greater than one liter per day and also check her daily weights.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTTL</PHI> is an 81-year-old gentleman
whose chief complaint was abdominal pain and diarrhea. He had a
past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent
complex medical history including a septic right knee arthritis
with MRSA complicated by a PICC line-induced right upper extremity
DVT followed by bacteremia with multi-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae , treated with meropenem for 14 days with the course
ending on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/30/2921.</PHI> The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal
pain during his last admission 2 weeks ago associated with low-volume mucus
diarrhea , C. diff toxin assay was at that time negative on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/15//2921.</PHI>
Abdominal CT showed diverticulosis with stranding of the sigmoid colon.
Blood cultures grew klebsiella , treated with 14 days of meropenem
as previously noted. However , since this discharge , the mild
abdominal pain persisted. He continues to have low-grade mucus
diarrhea about 5 times a day , not associated with fever , chills
or anorexia. Over the last 2 days prior to this admission , the
diarrhea became high volume , still nonbloody and not associated
again with fever or chills. He was brought into the emergency
department at which time , he was afebrile with a blood pressure
of 85/49 , heart rate in the 80s , respiratory rate of 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. At that time , he received volume
resuscitation with 2 liters of IV fluids , stool samples for C.
diff assay were sent. He received empiric therapy with p.o.
vancomycin. An abdominal CT in the emergency department showed
thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease as noted
with an anterior MI in 2003 , that had complicated to VT arrest ,
status post CABG in 2003 that was a left internal mammary artery
to LAD with saphenous vein graft to the PTA and obtuse marginal.
He has had a catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/2921</PHI> that showed patent grafts
and drug-eluting stent to the left circumflex. He has chronic
kidney disease , baseline creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , C. diff colitis in 2003 , BPH ,
asthma , GERD , status post right upper extremity PICC-related DVT
and right knee septic arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: aspirin 81 mg , Plavix 75 mg , Coumadin 5 mg , digoxin 0.125 mg ,
Lasix 49 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg
daily , Flomax 0.4 mg daily and Flovent 110 mcg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: penicillin which caused hives and swelling.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He previously a smoker. He does not drink. He
is a nursing home resident.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , two
brothers who had coronary artery disease in their 60s. No family
history of cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals as previous noted , blood pressure
in the 80s/49 , heart rate 80 , regular , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. Patient was afebrile. Pertinent
physical findings included: Pulmonary: He had a prolonged
expiratory phase , but no crackles. Cardiovascular: Distant heart
sounds , regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No rubs or
gallops. Systolic ejection or murmur 3/6 at the left lower
sternal border. Abdomen: Obese , distended abdomen , left lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation. No rebound at this time.
Extremities are warm , 2+ pulses with 1+ bilateral lower extremity
edema to the shins. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , cranial
nerves grossly intact , no abnormalities.
admission abdominal CT showed bowel wall thickening in
the descending sigmoid colon and rectum. Chest x-ray showed
left-sided pleural effusion , atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs were significant for a white count of
15.7 , hematocrit of 35.5 and INR of 3.2. Electrolytes were
normal.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertension and
infectious etiology. He was stabilized there and transferred to
the floor within a few days.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoid
colon. Colitis was worse over the last month , associated with
diarrhea. Abdominal CT is consistent with an infectious
inflammatory bowel process. Given history of C. diff colitis , C.
diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others were
possible. Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low
forward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejection
fraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatory
colitis or nonspecific colitis. Stool samples were sent for a C.
diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.
Stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during
admission. Empiric treatment was started with p.o. vancomycin.
Patient's abdominal pain continued to improve and completely
resolved. By discharge , patient remained afebrile and white
blood cell count decreased. Advance patient's diet as tolerated
and by discharge the patient was up to soft solids. We added
lactobacillus p.o. for probiotics and patient also had flex sig
two days before discharge , showing resolving inflammation
consistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology. The flex sig
did not change his management. We did discharge the patient on a
2-week course p.o. vancomycin alone.
2. Coronary artery disease. Patient had no evidence for acute
coronary syndrome on admission. We continued his aspirin ,
Plavix , statin and beta-blocker. Patient had no ischemic issues
or coronary artery disease issues during his admission.
3. CHF. Patient has previous EF noted at 20% to 35% , so a
gentle hydration therapy at first in the MICU for hypertension
and then as patient's blood pressure increased , was able to
restart patient's Lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extra
fluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on the
Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. Also considered
restarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatient
follow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril ,
once patient is fully recovered.
4. Chronic kidney disease. Patient had a baseline of creatinine
1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the hospital with a creatinine of 1.0.
The patient was below baseline and remained below baseline during
admission. He did not have any renal issues.
5. Hematology. Patient has a history a line-induced DVT , has
been treated with Coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to how
along patient should be treated , given that the DVT was line
induced. Coumadin was therapeutic on admission , became
supertherapeutic in the MICU. Held Coumadin until INR fell below
3 , restarted Coumadin afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily , patient's
normal dose. Patient was therapeutic on discharge. Will follow
up with primary care physician for Coumadin monitoring.
6. Nutrition. Patient was in the MICU and was n.p.o. given
abdominal pain and colitis. When transferred to floor , was
started on liquid diet and advanced to soft solid diet. By
discharge , the patient did not have abdominal pain and most of
the diarrhea had resolved.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: The patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy
during the admission that showed colitis consistent with
inflammatory etiology.
DIAGNOSIS: Patient had repeated negative C. diff toxin assays ,
but colitis was presumed to be C. diff and given history , could
have been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Patient
continued to improve on vancomycin and thus was discharged with
presumed C. diff colitis diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS: LEFT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA.
STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-12-12.</PHI>
STATUS POST STERNAL WOUND DEBRIDEMENT ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-26-12.</PHI>
ADULT-ONSET DIABETES.
DEPRESSION.
RIGHT KNEE ARTHROSCOPY.
STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN 1994 AND 1996.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old male
status post coronary artery bypass
grafting and sternal wound infection , admitted with 3 days of
increasing shortness of breath. The patient has had severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately
20% , and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. He underwent
a 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein
grafts to the LVB , D1 and first obtuse marginal on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-12-12.</PHI> His
postoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection ,
with debridement performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-26-12.</PHI> He was put on vancomycin
and sent home 3 days prior to admission on intravenous vancomycin.
He felt okay , until 1 or 2 days prior to admission when he had
increased dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath. He also
complained of increasing orthopnea and a mild cough accompanied by
shaking chills the night prior to admission. He also complained of
mild upper and lower back pain. The patient denied dysuria. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY is as noted above. The patient has no known drug
ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were aspirin , 325 milligrams
each day , Captopril , 25 milligrams 3 times a day , digoxin , 0.125
milligrams each day , Lasix , 40 milligrams each day , Colace , 100
milligrams twice a day , NPH insulin , 35 units each morning , regular
insulin , 5 units each evening , metoprolol , 25 milligrams 3 times a
day , Niferex , 150 milligrams twice a day , Percocet as needed ,
vancomycin , 1.25 milligrams twice a day , Axid , 150 milligrams twice
a day , and KCL , 40 milligrams each day. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed
the patient lives with his wife , he is an exposed smoker and
occasional ethanol drinker. He is retired secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. He was able to ambulate and play golf prior to the
coronary artery bypass grafting in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was uncomfortable , tachypneic.
Vital signs were temperature 100.7 , heart
rate 97 , blood pressure 108/67 , 96% oxygen saturation on 4 liters
by nasal cannula. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination
showed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round ,
reactive to light , oropharynx benign. Neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy. Chest showed left base bronchial breath sounds
with egophony , with a few scattered wheezes throughout.
Cardiovascular examination showed JVP approximately 8 centimeters ,
carotids were I+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 , S2 , very distant heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable.
Abdomen was nontender , positive bowel sounds. Skin showed the
upper chest wound where debridement had taken place , approximately
6 centimeters long at the incisional site , which was slightly
tender and erythematous. Back showed no costovertebral angle
tenderness. Extremities showed the patient had TEDS stockings on ,
there was trace edema , II+ pulses bilaterally. Neurologic
examination showed the patient was alert and oriented , fluent , and
the examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , SMA-7 showed sodium 135 ,
potassium 5.1 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate
22 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 128. CK was 13 , triponin 0.0.
Prothrombin time was 14.1 , partial thromboplastin time 27.5.
Digoxin level was 0.6. Complete blood count showed white blood
count 7.8 , differential 69 neutrophils , 16 lymphs , 7 monos , 8
eosinophils , hematocrit 28.7 , platelets 735 , 000. Sputum from
<PHI TYPE="DATE">1-31-12</PHI> showed 4+ Hemophilus influenza , which was pan sensitive.
Chest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate with possible effusion. Electrocardiogram showed left
bundle branch block. VQ scan was low probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Infectious disease. The patient had a
maximum temperature of 102.3 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-7-12.</PHI> He was
on vancomycin , gentamicin and ceftazidime. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-8-12</PHI> , gentamicin
and ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was started
secondary to decreasing creatinine. After his temperature spike on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2-7-12</PHI> , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of the
following days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. The
sternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued on
vancomycin for the coagulase negative Staphylococcus that grew from
the wound site on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-26-12.</PHI> The patient had a computerized
tomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternal
wound site and no abscess was seen. Thoracentesis was done on the
left pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with pH 7.51 ,
glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , LDH 38. There were 756
white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%
mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid was
grossly blood. Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria
and fungal growth. Gram stain showed no organisms , no
polymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48
hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. Given
his recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will be
continued for 2 weeks after discharge. Ofloxacin will also be
continued for the same. All cultures from this hospitalization are
negative to date.
2. Cardiovascular. The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction. VQ scan was low probability on admission. This was
performed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. Lower extremity
noninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative for
deep vein thrombosis. The patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.
The patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial
dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive
heart failure. His admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , and
weight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. With aggressive diuresis
during hospitalization , Lasix was discontinued on the day prior to
discharge. Digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was
1.0. The patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolic
blood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. Captopril and
Lopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during his
hospitalization. On discharge , he was on a stable dose of
Captopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and Lopressor , 12.5
milligrams twice a day. He was not orthostatic on the day prior to
discharge.
3. Renal. The patient was aggressively diuresed. His BUN and
creatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and
2.6 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-11-12.</PHI> Subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2-13-12</PHI> , BUN was 37 , creatinine 2.2. The patient had an
eosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-10-12</PHI> , and subsequently
decreased to 11% on discharge. Urine eosinophils were not present.
It appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , which
was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-8-12.</PHI> It is unlikely that his increasing
renal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. More
likely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to
decrease his congestive heart failure. Follow-up laboratory values
will likely reveal improvement in BUN and creatinine status , as
well as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.
4. Psychiatry. The patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,
and has been treated successfully with Ativan , but Serax resulted
in nightmares. The patient has a history of depression and may
benefit from counseling. The patient's decreased oral intake ,
nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying
depressive component over his prolonged illness.
5. Endocrine. The patient's blood sugar levels have been well
controlled on a regimen of NPH , 20 each morning. He has not
required any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage has
been discontinued for 2 days.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is fair. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE are Tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every
4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325
milligrams by mouth each day , Captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouth
every 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,
digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , Benadryl , 25 to 50
milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , Colace ,
100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , NPH insulin , 20 units
subcutaneously each morning , Atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times a
day , Ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as needed
for anxiety and insomnia , Lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twice
a day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rate
less than 60 , Niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,
Sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gram
intravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , Axid , 150 milligrams by
mouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day
times 7 days.
The patient will be transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valadez Columbus Gonzales</PHI>
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-14-12.</PHI> He will have a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Quint V. Josiah</PHI>
in approximately 2 weeks.

HOSPITAL COURSE
BRIEF OPERATIVE NOTE:
Date of surgery , <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/17/20.</PHI>
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
See magna valve three months prior. EPL on echo showed grossly
mobile on the stable aortic valve prosthesis moderate , MR. No
vegetations.
PROCEDURE:
Reoperation of ascending aortic dissection , aortic valve
replacement , #24 homograph , MVP with Alfieri suture.
BYPASS TIME:
355 minutes ,
CROSSCLAMP TIME:
265 minutes.
One ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal
tube , two left pleural tubes and two right pleural tubes were
placed.
FINDINGS:
Dense inflammatory edematous scar tissue throughout pericardium ,
especially periaortic. Right axillary cannulation with 6 mm
Hemashield side. Percutaneous right CF decannulation.
Uneventful re-sternotomy.
Previous SVG PDA injured during dissection , repaired with
interrupted 7-0 Prolene. Aortic valve prosthesis dehisced 3/4 of
circumference with question of an abscess cavity near LCC/RCC
junction. Debridement , the annulus is of extensive inflammatory
tissue. Previous Dacron aortic root patch removed due to pocket
of pus on the anterior aspect. No. 24 allograft placed with
double layer proximal suture line. SVG and both coronary
arteries implanted as buttons. Distal suture line continuous 4-0
Prolene. Transaortic and mitral valves replaced.
After the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiac
intensive care unit in stable condition. His postoperative
course was complicated by the following:
1. Infectious disease: Although , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> had multiple blood
cultures , sent , they all proved to be negative as of the date of
discharge. Although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> was never felt to be bacteremic ,
the cultures that were sent from the operating room were of the
aortic valve prosthesis. This never showed the organisms
identified on Gram stain and MSSA stain. However , the infectious
disease physicians were consulted and felt that Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> should
be on vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin. As at the time of
discharge , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> has finished his regimen of gentamicin and
will continue to be on both vancomycin and rifampin until
<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/1/19.</PHI> The rifampin he will take orally and the vancomycin he
will get after dialysis three times a week. While an inpatient ,
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> never had any evidence of leukocytosis or bacteremia.
2. Cardiovascular: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> was noted to have a first-degree
AV block on postoperative day #7 with a PR interval of 0.35. Up
into this point he had been receiving labetalol. This was held
and the electrophysiology consult was obtained. The
electrophysiology service saw the patient agreed to be an
excellent candidate for permanent pacemaker. Initially they
attempted to gain access to the right brachiocephalic/subclavian.
However , this proved to be difficult and ultimately obtain
access through the left iliac. His permanent pacemaker was
placed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/30/20</PHI> and was interrogated the following day and
felt to be functioning appropriately. He was restarted on his
labetalol and as of the time of discharge , has had no symptoms.
Other than the above , Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> was weaned from his oxygen
requirement , mobilized rapidly following surgery. All epicardial
pacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication.
He will be discharged home on the following medications aspirin
325 mg p.o. daily , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , labetalol100
mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg p.o.
6 hours p.r.n. pain , rifampin 300 mg p.o. q.8h. , vancomycin for
which he will receive following dialysis until <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/09/20</PHI> , Zocor 40
mg p.o. q.h.s. , losartan 100 mg p.o. daily. Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LWIWGW</PHI> will
follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HTXESG</PHI> , cardiac surgeon , in six weeks , and Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hicks , Alfreda Ozella</PHI> , cardiologist , in three to four weeks , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">CSGIWD</PHI> , the
patient's primary care physician , in one to two weeks and Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">QSOGTA</PHI> , cardiologist , in two weeks.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been admitted to the hospital with chest pain. Your chest pain
is likely due to a combination of your coronary artery disease and
anxiety. You did not have a heart attack. Rather this appears to be
stable angina and your current medication regimen is maximized for this
treatment. You also developed a fast heart rhythm called atrial flutter
when you were admitted , but your heart returned to normal rhythm on its
own. Thus , no medications are being started for this. As an
outpatient you will get an ECHO and also some heart monitoring that
will be arranged by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Normand Uriarte</PHI> You will be called with the times for
this. You should continue the same medications that you were previously
taking. If you develop light-headedness , chest pain , or shortness of
breath , you should call your doctor.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
*PCP - patient will need ECHO and Cardiac Monitoring as an outpatient.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Deann Lance Holly</PHI> M.D.
DISCHARGE DATE: To be determined.
SERVICE: GMS <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</PHI>
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Failure to thrive.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , postherpetic neuralgia , atrial fibrillation , and urinary
tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation status
post pacemaker placement , and chronic venous stasis who presents
with nausea , vomiting , and failure to thrive. The patient was
recently admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> in early
<PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and lower
extremity cellulitis. She was treated with diuresis ( ultimately
with ethacrynic acid as she developed a rash on torsemide and
itching with Lasix ) and a seven-day course of levofloxacin. At
the end of this admission , she was sent to a rehabilitation
facility. The patient had returned on the day of admission to
see her primary care physician. She had been vomiting and
appears severely dehydrated. She reported nausea and vomiting
for eight to nine days , intermittent nonbloody , nonbilious. She
also reported dysphagia for the last two months. She describes
recent dysuria. She also states that she has had no bowel
movement for a week prior to admission. She has had flatus. She
also complains of a baseline right ear pain due to her
postherpetic neuralgia. She has significantly decreased p.o.
intake with increasing generalized weakness. She denies chest
pain or shortness of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , T6 fracture and lower back pain , history of herpes zoster
with postherpetic neuralgia affecting the right face and ear ,
atrial fibrillation status post pace replacement , and history of
guaiac-positive stools.
MEDICATIONS: Colace , senna , lisinopril 5 mg q. day , Lopressor 25
mg b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , OxyContin 10 mg
q.12h. , calcium 500 mg t.i.d. , Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d. , Fosamax
70 mg q. week , Protonix 40 mg q. day , and ethacrynic acid 25 mg
b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Lasix , torsemide , penicillin , erythromycin , capsicum ,
and quinidine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Recently at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cliff Darcy Cunningham</PHI> in
<PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</PHI> , otherwise , lives alone in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</PHI> At baseline is
ambulatory with a walker. Remote history of tobacco , quit 50
years ago. No history of alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Asthma and heart disease in three brothers.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 96 , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 119/56 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 99% on
room air. The patient is alert , but uncomfortable and ill
appearing. HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact. Mucous membranes are dry.
Oropharynx is otherwise clear. There is ptosis of the right lid
( baseline ) and exquisite tenderness over the right base and right
ear. Neck: JVP is 7 cm. Neck is otherwise supple with no
tenderness to palpation. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds. Foley in place
draining a dark , cloudy urine. Extremities: Violaceous skin
changes of the legs bilaterally. 2+ edema. There is an area of
erythema in the left medial great toe , but no evidence of
infected ulceration. Neuro: Alert and oriented x3. Cranial
nerves intact ( except right lid ptosis ). The patient did not
feel well enough to cooperate with a full neurologic exam , but
her strength was symmetric throughout.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for a chemistry panel within
normal limits. BUN was 22 , creatinine 1.1 , white count was
13.27 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 448 , 000 , ALT 25 , AST 35 ,
alkaline phosphatase 339 , total bilirubin 1.0 , albumin 4.0 ,
amylase 39 , and lipase 14.
IMPRESSION: An 87-year-old female presenting with nausea ,
vomiting , and dehydration as well as dysuria , most likely mainly
due to urinary tract infection secondary to chronic Foley
placement.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: No acute issues. The patient was continued on her
beta-blocker. No aspirin was given , as the patient is on
Coumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.
b. Pump: The patient was dry on admission in the setting of
nausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. Her last echo
showed an EF of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,
mild-to-moderate MR as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclear
etiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmHg plus right atrial
pressure ). Initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was held
given dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of her
admission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain a
slightly negative fluid balance. The patient was also continued
on her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor after she was adequately
hydrated for blood pressure control.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She has a pacer placed and is V-paced. She is on
Coumadin with her INR at goal.
2. Pulmonary: The admission chest x-ray was read as a streaky
opacity of the right lung base possibly representing an
infiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.
The patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lung
exam clear ).
3. GI: The patient had nausea , vomiting for several days prior
to admission with decreased p.o. intake. She also reported no
bowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. A KUB was
obtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction or
free air. The patient was given stool softeners and laxatives
p.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. She was
continued on Nexium for her history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease. The patient's nausea and vomiting improved overall
throughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.
There is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it was
thought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,
which were increased early on in her hospitalization to address
her postherpetic neuralgia. The patient's nausea improved with
Reglan. Nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.
The patient had significantly better p.o. intake. The patient
also complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,
this occurred mainly with solid foods. Per Speech and Swallow ,
the patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid diet
and is concerned for an obstructive lesion. A video swallow was
obtained on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/1/20.</PHI> This study showed no aspiration and normal
passage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note was
made of cricopharyngeal prominence ). Speech and Swallow
recommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patient
has tolerated well. The patient has a history of an elevated
alkaline phosphatase ( with elevated GGT ) of unclear etiology.
Abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> 2005
showed gallstones , but no other process to explain the
abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. The patient had no right
upper quadrant pain on this admission.
4. Renal/FEN: The patient was initially given intravenous
fluids for dehydration. She was also found to have a urinary
tract infection and was initially started on levofloxacin
empirically. The urine culture returned was Staph aureus ( the
patient has had indwelling Foley ) and the patient was switched to
doxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,
and erythromycin ). Blood cultures were negative. The patient
has been afebrile through this admission. She was also noted to
have a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt was
made to remove her Foley catheter. This was thought most likely
due to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.
The patient will be discharged to rehab with her Foley in place
and is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Urology on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">March 13</PHI> , 2005.
5. Neuro: The patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting her
right face/ear. She was admitted on OxyContin and oxycodone ,
which was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortable
and Neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.
Given her nausea and urinary retention , the patient's opioid
medications were decreased. A trial of a lidoderm patch on the
affected area was attempted prior to discharge.
6. Heme: The patient's INR was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on Coumadin for
her history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was on Nexium and Coumadin.
8. Code status: DNR/DNI.
9. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility. She will follow up with her primary
care doctor Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Unknow Quinley.</PHI> In addition , an appointment has
been made for her to see Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nicolas , Oren. Uhlman , Outlaw. Oretha</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 8</PHI> , 2005 at 9:30
a.m. In addition , an appointment has been made with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">NQSSUS</PHI>
in Neurology on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 13</PHI> , 2005 at 11:15 a.m. and it is requested
that the patient's basic metabolic panel be monitored while she
is on ethacrynic acid. In addition , her weight should be
followed daily to check for fluid accumulation. She will also
benefit from physical therapy as she is deconditioned. The
patient is stable at the time of this dictation.
The discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum to this
discharge summary.

ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Novella , Efren</PHI> M.D.
This is a discharge summary dictation addendum to the previously
dictated note dictated by <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Isley Ivonne</PHI> , PA-C , describing
Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">KWGJXN</PHI> ' preoperative history , physical , operative procedure
( CABG x3 ) on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/18/21</PHI> and postoperative course from <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/18/21</PHI>
through <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/28/21.</PHI>
While on the cardiac surgery step-down unit , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">KWGJXN</PHI> continued
to demonstrate swollen ecchymotic area at the left lower extremity
along the SVG harvest site incision with white blood cell count
rising to 15.6 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/28/21</PHI> , although remaining afebrile. A left
lower extremity ultrasound obtained at that time revealed a fluid
collection along the prior SVG tract , corresponding to the area with
the most significant erythema. Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">KWGJXN</PHI> was continued on
vancomycin and levofloxacin and was taken back to the operating
room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/29/21</PHI> for drainage and irrigation of left lower extremity
endoscopic saphenous vein harvest site. No obvious purulence was noted
in the operating room. Cultures were sent from the OR which
subsequently revealed no growth. Postoperatively , the wound was
packed with wet-to-dry dressing , changed daily , and the patient
was continued on vancomycin IV antibiotics with white blood cell
count improving. Following operative reintervention , SVG harvest
site incision appeared less inflamed , less tender and less erythematous ,
with corresponding improvement in cellulitis. A plan had been made to
subsequently discharge the patient on postoperative day #13 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/1/21.</PHI>
A long line was placed at this time in anticipation of discharge for
continuation of seven days of IV vancomycin. However , white blood
count rose to 19.4 on planned day of discharge , <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/1/21</PHI> , and ,
althought the patient remained afebrile and the wound continued to
remain clean with minimal cellulitis , Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">KWGJXN</PHI> was kept inpatient
overnight for continued observation and re-assessment of WBC. On
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/2/21</PHI> , white blood cell count improved to 14.3 , the patient
remained afebrile , and the wound continued to remain clean with
packing changed wet-to-dry daily. Additional sources of leukocytosis
were sought including sputum culture , which subsequently demonstrated
no significant growth. Urinalysis was noted to be mildly dirty , for
which the patient began a short course of p.o. levofloxacin.

ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Agnes , Natasha Y.</PHI> M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Weakness , shortness of breath , and dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 48-year-old female who was discharged to home on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/15/21</PHI> from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hillary Hogan Clinic</PHI> after an ICU admission for
pneumonia and Klonopin overdose. Two days prior to admission
here , she experienced shortness of breath at rest and some
lightheadedness. At baseline , she becomes dyspneic after walking
20 feet secondary to obesity and many years of smoking. She also
notes several days of headache and some questionable darkening in
her visual fields bilaterally. She admits that her p.o. intake
has been rather poor since coming home secondary to anorexia and
that she has felt dehydrated. On review of systems , she also
notes chronic waxing and waning erythema of the right lower
extremity which in recent days has worsened with accompanying
swelling and mild tenderness , although her son says that it has
been worse in the past. Also , she has noted loose stools since
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/15/21.</PHI> She denies chest pain , pleurisy , abdominal pain , blood
in her stool or urine , dysuria , change in frequency , character or
urination , or focal weakness. No new medications other than a
recent antibiotic course at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hillary Hogan Clinic</PHI> completed there for
pneumonia. She has not taken her lisinopril or methadone in the
last two days. She has no sick contact. She saw her PCP on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/19/21</PHI> who found her to be hypotensive and hypoxic and then
sent her to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hillary Hogan Clinic</PHI> ED. Her family is not clear on her
discharge diagnosis , but they report that her kidney function was
abnormal and she was dehydrated. She was not admitted. She then
came to the ED at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> for persistent shortness of
breath and dizziness. In the ED , her vital signs were that she
was afebrile , her systolic blood pressure was in the high 60's ,
her heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate in the 30's , and O2
saturations were in the high 80's. She was given vancomycin ,
Levaquin and gentamicin and 3 liters of normal saline. She was
aggressively given fluids and was started on Levophed for blood
pressure support. Her EKG was notable for low voltage on
precordial leads and borderline right axis deviation. Chest
x-ray showed cardiomegaly , but otherwise clear. In the MICU , her
blood pressure was stabilized on Levophed , but she was also noted
to drop her blood pressure to the 70's when initiated on her home
BiPAP settings.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
She had endocarditis 20 years ago. She has obstructive sleep
apnea , on her home BiPAP , morbid obesity , and hypertension. She
had a right ankle injury more than 20 years ago during the motor
vehicle accident , which was complicated by an ankle infection.
She has chronic right lower extremity pain and she is on
methadone. She had a Klonopin overdose. She had Enterobacter
pneumonia. She was treated with cefepime at that time ,
questionable the vancomycin. She has a questionable diagnosis of
COPD with her extensive smoking history. In a well state , her
PCO2 was 49 , her O2 saturation is 89% , and she has also history
of depression.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Lisinopril and methadone. She is not taking her lisinopril. She
has in the past taken lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide.
ALLERGIES:
She is allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She smoked half a pack a day for 30 years. No alcohol for three
years. No illicit drugs. She lives at home , but does not work.
She is on disability.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was afebrile , heart rate in the 100's , blood pressure 130/80 ,
respiratory of 18 , and O2 saturation 95% on 8 liters of oxygen.
She was awake and alert and in no acute distress. She is
anicteric , without pallor. She had a thick neck. Pulmonary:
She had decreased breath sounds and crackles at the bases
bilaterally. Cardiovascular: She was tachy , regular , but
distant S4. JVP was difficulty to ascertain secondary to neck
habitus. Her abdomen was obese , + bowel sounds , nontender and
nondistended. Extremities were without erythema of her legs , but
with mild swelling of the right lower ankle. The ankles were
without swelling and with full range of motion. Neurologically ,
she was alert and oriented , but unfocused in conversation , moving
all her extremities. Her strength was intact.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
Please see LMR.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a 49-year-old woman with a recent ICU stay at an outside
hospital who presented with hypotension , tachycardia , and acute
renal failure. Presentation was most consistent with right
pulmonary embolus and right ventricular failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary/Vascular: There was initial concern for a PE given
the presentation of severe hypotension , tachycardia , and Aa
gradient without evidence of infection or primary cardiac
disease. An echo showed a dilated RV with depressed RV function
suggestive of PE. Her initial PE scan was nondiagnostic
secondary to poorly timed contrast and motion of the patient. A
VQ scan showed intermediate probability. She was started on
heparin drip with a goal of 60 to 80. Her second PECT showed a
small PE to the right upper lobe , but it was not large enough to
explain her dramatic presentation. The working hypothesis is
that there was a significant recanalization prior to this repeat
CT which took place two days after the first CT. She was
initially on oxygen in the ICU. She was never intubated. She
was on face mask , and upon transfer to the floor , she was on
nasal cannula 4 liters. Her O2 saturations were acceptable
in-house , although she did desaturate to 90% when she took her
oxygen off a night. She multiple times refused BiPAP while in
the hospital , but she will go back on it when she returns home.
2. Cardiovascular: She had a mild troponin elevation on
admission , likely secondary to RV strain. She had severe
hypotension and was on two pressors. She was weaned off of these
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/23/21</PHI> , but did have an episode of hypotension when her
BiPAP was started. She was given a little bit of low dose
dobutamine and then she was weaned off of that on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/25/21.</PHI>
Rhythm: She has no active issues. We continued to hold her
lisinopril while in-house. Her blood pressures were stable , but
not high enough to withstand on additional blood pressure
lowering medication. It was discussed with her PCP that she
perhaps will need this medication restarted as an outpatient.
She does have a history of severe hypertension.
3. Renal: As she was in acute failure on admission with a
creatinine of 6.9 , it dropped to 0.5 , most likely this was due to
prerenal azotemia and decreased renal perfusion in the setting of
hypotension. Hypoperfusion of the kidneys in setting of
hypovolemia and right heart failure resulting in decreased left
ventricular preload. Mucomyst and bicarb were given prior to the
PECTs of her renal protection. She did not develop any
additional contrast nephropathy after her CT scans. Her
creatinine on discharge was 0.6.
4. Endocrine: She had a normal increase in her cortisol level
with ACTH stimulation. Her fingersticks were monitored while she
was in-house and she never had any need for supplemental insulin.
5. FEN: She was on a house diet.
6. ID: She was empirically covered on admission with
vancomycin , levofloxacin and gentamicin. Her antibiotics were
given again on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/21/21</PHI> and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22/21.</PHI> There was no evidence
of an infection found , no fever , normal white count , with a
normal differential , normal UA , chest x-ray is without
infiltrate , and antibiotics were discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/23/21.</PHI> She
continued to remain afebrile in-house without any evidence of
infection.
7. Urology: She did complain of bladder spasms while having the
Foley in place. She was started on Ditropan. She had multiple
negative urinalysis and urine cultures. Once the Foley was
discontinued , she was able to void and she stopped having bladder
spasms. She was started on Monistat for a yeast infection.
8. Allergy: She did have an elevated eosinophilia on
presentation and it was 4% on admission and increased to 8% on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/23/21.</PHI> On the day of discharge , it was 7.5. There is no
clinical evidence of allergy , rheumatic disease or parasitic
infection. Her obstructive lung disease may be of an asthma
variant , and there is the possibility she may need inhaled
corticosteroids as an outpatient.
9. Heme: She was on unfractionated heparin for her presumed PE
until <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/26/21</PHI> and then she was changed to Lovenox in the morning
of that day on 120 mg subq. Her weight at that time was 157 kg.
Her Coumadin , her initially given 10 , then a dose of 5 and then 2
dose of 7.5. Her INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at
2.5. She will continue on the Lovenox for two additional days.
Her INR will be monitored by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Stafford</PHI> , her PCP.
10. Psych/Addiction: We are continuing her methadone. It has
been switched from 20 mg p.o. daily to 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. She was
also given a little bit of Ativan while in-house to help with her
agitation and anxiety. She was initially given a little bit of
Haldol , but that was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/25/21</PHI> and there was no
additional need for that. She did have a central line placed on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22/21</PHI> , which was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/26/21</PHI> without any evidence
of any line infection and without any problems. She was seen by
Social Work and PT. The patient refused to go to any sort of
rehab or nursing home. It was decided that the patient would
return home with skilled nursing and with PT as needed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with
a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels
chronically , CAD , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% in
LVH , recently discharged from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/14</PHI>
and subsequently transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hattie Connie.</PHI> The patient
presents with increased shortness of breath. The prior admission
was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no
dictated summary available ). The patient reported doing well in
rehab for several days. However , over the past 2-3 days the
patient developed increased shortness of breath , and dyspnea on
exertion with very minimal movement. The patient reports stable
two pillow orthopnea. No upper respiratory symptoms. No fevers ,
chills , nausea or vomiting. The patient without palpitation.
The patient does report that shortness of breath was increased
over past baseline. The patient also notes noted increased
hematuria , although the patient has had a chronic hematuria for
over 1-2 years per patient. The patient does report that he had
a Foley in during the prior admission , and has had increased
hematuria since that discharge. The patient denies chest pain.
The patient was felt to have "crackles" at the rehab , and was
sent to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valentine &Walters; Allie Clinic</PHI> for further care. In ED
the patient was afebrile , heart rate of 74 , blood pressure
127/75 , and satting 95% on room air. He was given 80 IV Lasix ,
Percocet and Lactulose for elevated ammonia. Labs were notable
for elevated BNP of 655 , elevated ammonia of 83.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile with a heart rate
of 82 , blood pressure 132/72 , respiratory rate 94% on room air ,
weight 420 lbs. General: Morbidly obese , speaking in full
sentences. HEENT: Oropharynx clear , anicteric sclerae. Neck:
JVP less than 6 cm though difficult to assess secondary to
habitus. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: RRR , no MRG , no
S3 or S4 appreciated. Lungs: Increased crackles at the bases.
Abdomen: Obese , no obvious liver edge , no fluid wave.
Extremities: Lower extremity edema approximately 2-3+. Skin:
The patient with chronic excoriations on abdomen ( the patient
reports they have been improving over the past year ) , and the
patient also with chronic ulcer/lesions throughout lower legs
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3.
Motor strength someone decreased proximal leg and arms.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO2
26 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,
albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of
137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normal
limits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). First set of ED enzymes
were negative. BNP elevated at 655. Ammonia elevated at 83.
INR 1.2 , PTT 36.
Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which
were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with
obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. EKG
first degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??
vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. UA with 3+ blood ,
15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. Of note , renal
ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/5/18</PHI> ( prior admission )I revealed no
hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.
ETT MIBI on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/8/18</PHI> stress images only performed revealed small
area of myocardial scar in mid LAD/diagonal territory with
moderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. Echo performed
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/2/18</PHI> revealed an EF of 45-50% , positive LVH. Inferior and
lateral hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positive
MIBI in <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/2918.</PHI> The patient with no EKG changes , and also no
chest pain. The patient initially continued on aspirin , beta
blocker and a statin. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21/18</PHI> the patient with a troponin
leak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. The patient
also had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previously
described MIBI. At that time cardiology was following and
recommended medical management secondary to difficulty with
aggressive intervention in this patient. For this admission ,
cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing a
repeat MIBI to assess. The MIBI was completed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26/18</PHI> and
results are pending at the time of this dictation. Again , very
difficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.
Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. To follow up with
Cardiology for further read of the MIBI test. Pump: The patient
with elevated BNP and some fluid overload. Chest x-ray as
described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly
improved from before ). It was felt that the patient's shortness
of breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. So ,
the patient's Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( from
b.i.d. dosing ). Prior echo is as described above , revealing an
EF of 45%. The patient did have successful diuresis on the
increased Lasix dosing. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24</PHI> the Lasix was lowered back to
b.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.
Creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26.</PHI> At time of
discharge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patient
was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without
alarms.
2. Pulmonary: The patient with shortness of breath increased
over baseline and chest x-ray as described above. Secondary to
the elevated BNP and increased lower extremity edema , the patient
was diuresed as described above. The patient does use BiPAP at
night for obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin sliding
scale and a.m. NPH. No ace inhibitor was added secondary to the
significantly elevated creatinine. The patient's NPH was
increased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars
( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).
4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondary
to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein
associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). The patient was
continued on Phoslo , Calcitriol and Epogen. The patient also
with increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.
Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was
largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large
habitus. Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive
intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely
secondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ).
The patient is status post Targis procedure as described above ,
and hematuria secondary to recent Foley trauma from past
admission. The patient to follow up with urology in the future.
A urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.
5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal
LFTs. This has also been worked up in the past according to the
patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. The patient is too
obese for any abdominal imaging per CT. The patient does have a
history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated
ammonia , versus a hepatic source. Ammonium level was 83. The
patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.
The patient's medication of Lactulose was continued.
6. Heme: The patient with chronic anemia as described in the
lab section. The patient did have an episode of epistaxis that
subsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , though
also somewhat improved at time of discharge. Hematocrit was
stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.
7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonal
gammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. The oncologist
attending , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nada</PHI> , who knows the patient felt there was
no need for additional chemo at this time. Previous Cytoxan
therapy has not been significantly effective.
8. Neuro: The patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,
proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. A neurology
consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to
deconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,
this is not likely secondary to a myositis. No further workup
was performed.
PLAN TO DO: The patient to be discharged to rehabilitation for
further care , physical therapy and medical management. The
patient to follow up with Cardiology , PCP and Urology. Continue
wound care dressing changes b.i.d.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12/2921</PHI>
ATTENDING: <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Pacheco , Alan Cotton Iverson</PHI> MD
PRIMARY ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary embolism.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Diabetes , hypertension , hypothyroid and
GERD.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 daily , lisinopril 5 daily ,
Protonix 40 daily , metformin 1500 daily , Lantus 60 daily , Humalog
20 before meals , Byetta 5 mcg twice daily , levothyroxine ( dose
unknown ) , OxyContin 40 every eight hours , Percocet two tabs every
3 hours as needed for pain and gabapentin ( dose unknown ).
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Syncope.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66-year-old man with
diabetes , hypertension , obesity and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the
right hip on chemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) , which began on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/20/21</PHI> and
will continue for 18 weeks. He reported no complications from
ischemic chemotherapy. At baseline he cannot bear weight on his
right leg and he devised this complicated system where he shifts
himself down the stairs to the bottom of the steps using his
upper body strength and a family member to assist him. All
during this maneuver he felt unusually short of breath the day of
admission and in the context of breathing heavily began to sweat
and feel lightheaded and then lost consciousness temporarily.
Sister was present and called EMS. On arrival to the emergency
room , he was hypotensive and received IV normal saline as volume
resuscitations. His pressures initially were noted to be in the
70s to 80s systolic and improved to 90 systolic after 4 L of
fluid from the emergency room. The patient was admitted for
syncope. On admission as part of the workup for syncope an
initial set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam , the patient was
afebrile , heart rate in the 90s , blood pressure systolic 100 ,
respirations 20 and O2 sat 94% on room air. Pupils were equal ,
round and reactive to light. There was no cervical
lymphadenopathy. JVP was not visualized due to large neck.
Lungs were clear. The heart was regular. There was an S1 , S2
with a loud and widened split P2 component of the second heart
sound. Abdomen was soft and nontender. The right hip was tender
to palpation. The extremities had 1+ edema bilaterally.
The patient was admitted with a preliminary diagnosis of syncope.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The second set of cardiac enzymes was positive
with a troponin of 2. Echocardiogram the morning following
admission showed a dilated right ventricle consistent with right
ventricular strain. This was followed by a PE protocol CT scan ,
which showed a large saddle embolus. The patient was treated
initially with IV heparin , transitioned to Coumadin and then the
decision was made to try Lovenox therapy for long-term
anticoagulation. Cardiac enzymes normalized. Repeat
echocardiogram showed mild improvement in right heart function.

Imp: 74 yo woman with pulmonary sarcoid and CHF and CRI here with SOB
after stopping lasix several weeks ago. Given clinical exam and CXR it
appears that she is in decompensated CHF , and in worse renal failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) Cardiovascular: She was in mildly decompensated CHF , and was started
on more aggressive diuresis , starting with lasix 40 iv BID increased to 80
bid on HD2 as she was not meeting her diuresis goal. With cardiology
service consulting , she was increase to lasix drip at 15/hr on HD3 , with
i/o goal 1-2 l neg. She did well on this and by HD5 was near her dry
weight of 49kg and her drip was transitioned back to PO lasix. She is no
on lasix 80 po bid , which is felt to be adequate to maintain her dry
weight. She was continued on Hydralazine , lopressol and was restarted on
Isordil on HD3 , titrated up to 20 tid. She has history of MI with
stents and was continued on Asa , Plavix , Zocor. He cardiac enzymes were
negative. Her BNP fell from 3500 on admit to 1500 at her dry wt on HD6.
She was paced intermittent ( pacer placed in past for sick sinus ,
functioning properly at a backup rate of 50 ).
2 ) Renal: She presented with acute on chronic RF possibly due to poor for
forward flow in the setting of CHF decompensation. Cr up to 3.6 on
HD3 , but as she diuresed , her Cr stabilized. Renal consult was following
and recommended diureses , low K diet , good glucose control , and
withholding ace inhibitor. She is discharge at her dry weight with a Cr
stable at 3.5. She should probably not go on Ace Inhibitor again.
3 ) FEN- Hyperkalemia w/o EKG change. Improved w/ lasix. Rec'd Kayexylate
in ED. Now improved. Follow K/Mg. She should not be on an Ace inhibitor
or a K-sparing diuretic.
4 ) ENDO- glipizide at home which was restarted on HD5. Add insulin SS for
tight control. TSH high. T4 low. This should be rechecked as an outpt
before initiating therapy.
5 ) Heme- ON coumadin for history DVT. Held on HD3 for an INR
3.1 and was restarted shortly after , but her INR is 1.4. She
received 1.5 U of PRBC for goal HCT &gt;30 and is currently 30.8. Her
anemia is 2/2 chronic renal disease and she was started on
darbopoetin 25 qwk. She developed a clot in her Right external
jugular ( site of prior IV ) and was place on renal dose of lovenox
until her INR&gt;2. Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is &gt;2.
6 ) Neuro- On dilantin for history of partial seizures.
7 ) Code- no CPR if sudden death , but intubation/defibrillation ok in the
setting of instability.
Dispo: She was discharged to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Jerome Gardner</PHI> at a euvolemic state with a dry
weight of 49kg. She should continue on 80 po lasix bid unless her Cr rises
above new baseline of 3.5 or if she gains weight or shows signs of new
overload. Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is &gt; 2. Coumadin dose
should be adjusted according to INR goal 2-3. She should be on a renal
diet with low potassium and low glucose but with diabetic caloric
supplements like GLUCERNA. She should receive a HOT PACK to her neck 2-3x
per day and to her vein before blood draw for comfort.
She should receive physical therapy daily with the goal of gait stability ,
home safety , and good O2 sats on 2L O2. She should go home with home O2 at
2L and with VNA services for meds. She lives at home alone and it would be
ideal if she had a relative stay with her for a few days to a week after
going home.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/11/2905</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a morbidly obese , 53
year old , white male who presented
with new onset chest pain and melena. He had been in his usual
state of good health and was without known cardiac risk factors.
The night prior to the night of admission , while walking from the
bathroom to his bed in the heat , he developed new chest tightness
which he described as somebody sitting on his chest. He had
shortness of breath and diaphoresis but no nausea , vomiting ,
palpitations or radiation. He returned to this bed , and the pain
resolved after several minutes of rest. He was without further
episodes until the night of admission , when walking to work he had
2-3 episodes of chest tightness similar to the night before. Each
of them lasted at most 10-15 minutes. He went to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI> emergency ward for evaluation. He denied any pain
like this previously. He denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or
orthopnea but did have daily ankle swelling for the past five
minutes and some new shortness of breath after walking 200 yards
over the past 5-6 months. He also reported two episodes of black
loose stools , one 2-3 weeks prior to admission and one on the night
of admission. He had some transient abdominal discomfort 2-3 weeks
prior to admission which he treated with ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. to
q.i.d. for 3-4 days. He had no recent abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , hematemesis , hematochezia or coffee ground emesis. He
was without history or family history of peptic ulcer disease. He
was without recent weight loss or gain. He has had long time
ingestion of 6-8 beers a day but no recent binges. He took four
Excedrin the day prior to admission for a headache. An NG tube in
the emergency ward showed bilious material which was guaiac
negative. He denied fevers , chills , cough , sputum , dysuria ,
obstructive urinary symptoms , headache , visual changes ,
paresthesias , early satiety or bleeding diatheses. PAST HISTORY:
Chronic nasal congestion; right sciatica. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION: Sudafed p.r.n. ALLERGIES: None known. FAMILY
HISTORY: Mother died of cancer; father died of "heart failure" in
his late 60s. No family history of diabetes mellitus or
hypertension. SOCIAL HISTORY: He smoked four and a half packs of
cigarettes per day times 15 years; quit 15 years ago. He drinks
6-8 beers a day. He lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</PHI> with his wife and three
of his seven adult children. He has three small grandchildren. He
works the night shift as a fork lift operator for the post office.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a morbidly obese man in no
apparent distress. Pulse 84 and blood
pressure 142/80 lying; pulse 86 and blood pressure 150/100 sitting;
respirations 26; afebrile. The head was normocephalic and
atraumatic. The extraocular muscles were intact; pupils equal ,
round and reactive to light; conjunctivae clear. The oropharynx
was clear. The neck revealed full range of motion; no thyromegaly;
no masses; unable to evaluate JVD secondary to a thick neck. There
was no CVA or spinal tenderness. The chest was clear to
auscultation and percussion; decreased breath sounds throughout;
barrel chest. The cardiovascular exam revealed a nearly inaudible
S1 and S2; no murmurs audible. The abdomen was soft and
protuberant; nontender; normal bowel sounds. The extremities were
without clubbing , cyanosis , clear edema or calf tenderness or
swelling. The neuro exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam revealed
black and maroon guaiac positive stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Hematocrit 37.0; white blood cell count
17.2 with 75 polys , 1 band , 18 lymphs , 4
monos , 2 eos; platelets 439 , 000; sodium 136; potassium 4.4;
chloride 104; CO2 23; BUN 60; creatinine 2.0; glucose 168; calcium
10.2; phosphate 3.8; protein 7.3; albumin 4.6; AST 37; ALT 23; LDH
271; alkaline phosphatase 87; cholesterol 210; triglyceride 226;
CPK 72 on admission. The chest x-ray showed fat in the
mediastinum , normal heart , no infiltrate or effusion. A KUB showed
no obstruction or free air. A tagged red blood cell scan in the EW
was negative for bleeding source. The EKG showed a normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 90; frequent PVCs; intervals 0.15 , 0.07 and
0.39; axis 40 degrees; flipped T wave in L; flat Ts in V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: #1 ) Angina. The patient was admitted with a
story classic for angina. He was admitted for a
rule out MI protocol. His EKG remained essentially unchanged. He
was noted to be in bigeminy and had some frequent PVCs on several
EKGs and on monitor , however , his EKG remained unchanged except for
some labile T waves in the lateral lead which changed with lead
placement. He was ruled out for an MI with CPKs which actually
went up from a CK of 72 to a peak of 331 , but on electrophoresis
there was no MB fraction found. The bump in the CK level was felt
to be secondary to multiple attempts at a central line placement in
the EW and skeletal muscle trauma. He was treated with sliding
scale Nitropaste and nifedipine for blood pressure control in the
hospital. An echocardiogram was done to assess left ventricular
function which revealed no regional wall motion abnormality , some
slight decrease in compliance but good LV function. An exercise
tolerance test could not be completed secondary to his sciatica.
On ETT he went for one minute and 44 seconds with a heart rate of
81-122 , blood pressure 136/80 to 144/80. There were no ST changes
noted. There were some asymptomatic VPBs and no chest pain. He
was discharged on Procardia XL 30 daily and given a prescription
for nitroglycerin and instructed on how to use this. #2 ) GI
bleed. He was admitted with melena and a falling hematocrit. A
hematocrit drawn at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CHCE</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> was 48 and on admission here was
37 and dropped to a low of 28. He received three units of packed
red blood cells in the hospital. An endoscopy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/11/05</PHI> showed
two small ulcers in the prepyloric antrum , one measuring 3 mm and
the other 5-6 mm. Both were superficial and benign appearing at
the time , and neither had stigmata of a recent bleed. Biopsies
were taken with good hemostasis. No varices or esophagitis were
noted. The GI bleed was presumed to be secondary to his ulcer
disease. He was treated during the hospitalization with an H2
blocker which was to continued for 8-12 weeks after discharge. He
was instructed to not take aspirin or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or to drink alcohol after discharge. The
discharge hematocrit was approximately 35 and remained stable. #3 )
Leukocytosis. He was noted to have a leukocytosis without bands on
admission. This resolved with hydration and was felt to be most
likely secondary to stress reaction. #4 ) Sleep apnea. He was
noted to be apneic at night by the nurses with sinus bradycardia
and sinus pauses during the apneic episodes. He had one sinus
pause at seven seconds. On the third night of admission , he was
monitored on a sat monitor overnight which noted him to desaturate
to the 60% and 70% range during his apneic episodes. He was
presumed to have sleep apnea and will be worked up as an outpatient
with a sleep study per Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Underhill.</PHI> #5 ) Renal. He had an
increased BUN and creatinine on admission. This decreased with
hydration. The discharge BUN was 23 and creatinine 1.1.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.
COMPLICATIONS: None. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
Pepcid 40 mg p.o. daily; Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. daily;
nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. chest pain. FOLLOW UP will
be with his internist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yamashita W. Conway</PHI> , and with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">EMESG</PHI> in eight
weeks for a repeat endoscopy and with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Underhill.</PHI> for a sleep study.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. NEW ONSET ANGINA.
2. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
3. SLEEP APNEA.

Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Warner</PHI> is an 81-year-old female with 5-year history of
known aortic stenosis. She has been followed by serial
echocardiograms. Most recent showed an aortic valve area of 0.7
cm2. She states that she does have some mild shortness of
breath. She was referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Naomi Williams</PHI> for aortic valve
replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , CVA , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , COPD ,
status post colon cancer , osteoarthritis , GERD.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
A 10-pack-year cigarette smoking history. She drinks one drink
nightly.
ALLERGIES:
Morphine causes itching.
MEDICATIONS:
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Advair Diskus
1 puff inhaler b.i.d. , atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. daily , Celebrex
200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs , heart rate 64 , blood pressure in the right arm
144/64 , blood pressure in the left arm 144/62. HEENT , right
carotid bruit. Cardiovascular: Irregular rhythm with a harsh 4/6
holosystolic murmur. Peripheral pulses are all 2+ and include
the carotid , radial , femoral , dorsalis pedis , posterior tibial.
Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Extremities are
without scarring , varicosities or edema. Neuro: Alert and
oriented with no focal deficits.
PREOPERATIVE LABS:
Sodium 137 , potassium 4 , chloride 100 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 29 ,
creatinine 0.7 , glucose 86 , magnesium 2 , white blood cells 5.50 ,
hematocrit 36.3 , hemoglobin 12.6 , platelets 196 , 000 , PT 12.8 , INR
0.9 , PTT 29.7 , hemoglobin A1c 5.8. Carotid imaging , left
internal carotid artery 25-40% occlusion , right internal carotid
artery , no occlusion. Cardiac catheterization dated <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20/20</PHI> ,
coronary anatomy right dominant circulation with normal coronary
arteries. Echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/23/19</PHI> shows aortic stenosis with
peak gradient 77 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2. Mitral
stenosis with peak gradient of 7 mmHg. ECG not recorded. Chest
x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/28/20</PHI> was read as normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Brief operative note , date of surgery <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/06/20.</PHI> preoperative
diagnosis , aortic stenosis. Postoperative diagnosis aortic
stenosis. Procedure aortic valve replacement with a #21
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve. Bypass time was 59 minutes ,
cross clamp time was 48 minutes. Two atrial wires , one
ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tube
replaced. Findings , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve.
Weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass , she was in complete heart
block. A wires and V wires were placed. After the operation ,
the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit in
stable condition. While in the cardiac intensive care unit , her
course was complicated by complete heart block immediately
following surgery. At that time , she had to be paced and
developed a junctional rhythm in the 30s. On postoperative day
#2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70's with occasionally paced
beats. At that time patient was started on no nodal agents of
any kind. Also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it was
found that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit of
packed red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since.
On postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to the
cardiac step-down unit. While on the cardiac step-down unit ,
course was complicated by the following: As stated previously ,
the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. She
developed rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 with
heart rates between 100 and 120. Because her epicardial pacing
wires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patient
would benefit from a beta-blocker. Lopressor was started and the
patient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without any
bradycardiac episodes. However , patient continued in and out of
atrial fibrillation for the next two days. On postoperative day
5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. Once the drip was
implemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. When
the diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker was
continued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normal
sinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. Of note , patient was
subtherapeutic on her INR prior to discharge. Her INR will be
closely followed by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> anticoagulation
clinic.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
She was discharged home in stable condition on the following
medications: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain , aspirin 81 mg
p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation ,
glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol
XL 150 mg p.o. daily , Advair Diskus 250/50 1 puff inhaler b.i.d. ,
atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Coumadin of which she will
receive 3 mg today.
PLAN:
As stated previously , patient is on Coumadin for her rapid atrial
fibrillation. Goal INR is 2-3. Please draw her INR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/15/20</PHI>
and then daily until therapeutic. <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI>
anticoagulation clinic will be following her INR. The phone
number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">516-620-4117.</PHI> The patient is to follow up with Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Willis.</PHI> , cardiac surgeon in six weeks and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Carr</PHI> cardiologist
in two weeks.

Cardiac catheterization <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/22/20</PHI> ; no interval change since last
catheterization. 100% LAD , 100% left circumflex , 20% RCA
stenosis , LIMA graft to the LAD , patent SVG to D1. Disease was
not amenable to intervention. Please see catheter report for
further details.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: Initial troponin was negative. No EKG changes but on
the second set of cardiac enzymes , the troponin was elevated to
0.82. The patient was sent to Cath Lab for NSTEMI on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/22/20</PHI> ,
with no interval change on cath noted and no intervention
performed. Troponins trended down thereafter less than assay.
The patient did have an episode of chest pain on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/26/20</PHI> in the
setting of systolic blood pressure of 200 without EKG changes
currently. After assessing source of troponin leak on admission ,
but positively secondary to demand in the setting of hypertension
and acute/pulmonary edema. We will continue beta-blocker , ACE
inhibitor , statin , Imdur , Plavix and aspirin as an outpatient.
Pump: EF preserved on cath. Volume overloaded on admission
likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema secondary to
hypertension , diastolic dysfunction. The patient was diuresed
well on 40 mg of Lasix p.o. during her stay with the team on an
outpatient maintenance dose of Lasix 60 mg daily. The patient
was euvolemic on discharge. The blood pressures were labile
initially but better controlled with amlodipine and an increased
dose of captopril. Will continue as an outpatient on
beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , calcium channel blocker.
Rhythm: Intermittent brachycardia to the high 30s , but always
asymptomatic. Lopressor dose was decreased from t.i.d. to b.i.d.
during her stay. She will continue on home dose of Toprol XL 25
mg p.o. daily.
Pulmonary: Status post acute shortness of breath episode prior to
admission requiring initially nonrebreather and nasal cannula
thereafter , which markedly improved with diuresis. The patient
was stable on room air at the time of discharge.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on her home insulin regimen
along with sliding scale , and she will be discharged on home
insulin regimen.
ID: The patient was noted to have a urinalysis consistent with
urinary tract infections and completed a 7-day course of
ciprofloxacin for complicating TI.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged in stable condition to rehab as an
outpatient.

Hospital Course:
62yo F with HTN , asthma and recent L total knee replacement
presented with extensive PE. She was extremely SOB and c/o pleuritic
chest pain. Her ekg and exam were not suggestive of cardiac
dysfunction. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was initially
anticoagulated with Heparin. However , her platelets were noted to drop
from 237 to 93. HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued. The
patient was started on Fondaparinux. A PF4 Antibody was sent and pending
at the time of discharge. Coumadin was started after one day of
Fondaparinux with an intent to bridge over at least 5 days with a goal
INR of 2-3. The patient's blood pressure was decreased over the course of
her admission. All antihypertensives were held. She may be preload
dependent in the setting of an acute PE. During her admission an
echocardiogram was performed. It did not show evidence of right heart
strain or LV dysfunction. Her EF was 65-70%. Over the course of the
hospitalzation , the patient's symptoms improved dramatically. Her oxygen
requirement decreased. Her vital signs remained stable.
The patients respiratory status remained stable on home regiment
of inhalers and nebulizers PRN.
Ortho evaluated the patient while hospitalized and recommended weight
bearing as tolerated. The patient did not require narcotics for pain
associated with TKR.
Heparin products should be avoided. The PF4 antibody will need to be
followed by the PCP.

present on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/07.</PHI>
Hospital Course:
CV: Based on exam and labs , the patient was felt to be in mild CHF
on admission. She was Rule out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes
x3. Trans-thoracic Echo was done which showed EF of 50-55% with
hypokinesis of anterior and antero-septal wall. Tissue dopplers
suggested diastolic dysfunction , no valvular abnormalities except
trace TR. The patient was started on an ACEI for better BP control ,
no betablocker given h/o asthma. On statin , increased dose to
simvastatin 80. TSH negative. The patient responded well to Lasix IV
diuresis and felt that her breathing was back to baseline after two
days of diuresis.
Pulm: The patient has a history of asthma and OSA; she was continued
on nebs , MDI , O2. Recieved 1 dose of steroids in ED , but these were
not continued since her presentation was more consistent with CHF.
The patient needs CPAP at night , but does not take this at home
since she lost her CPAP machine.
Renal: The patient has a hx of CRI ( 1.5-2.1 ) due to diabetes , her
creatinine was stable between 1.7-1.9 during her admission with
diuresis and the addition of the ACE inhibitor.
HEME: The patient was anemic with a Hct of about 28 on admission. Iron
studies sent which showed Fe of 23 and TIBC of 367 ( transferrin sat
approx 6% ) This is consistent with Fe deficient anemia. The patient's
Hct subsequently dropped to 24.5 with slightly guaiac pos stool and she
was transfused 2u PRBC with resulting Hct 29.9. The patient has a
family hx of colon cancer and she recently missed colonoscopy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> .
Should reschedule as an outpatient to start w/u for Fe def
anemia and guaiac pos stools.
Endo: The patietn has a hx of poorly controlled DM2 in the past with
HgbA1c as high as 12 , HbA1c was repeated and found to be 7.2%.
Diabetes management service was consulted and recommended continuation
of Lantus at 70u QAM with adjustment in Humalog sliding scale. The
patietn should be scheduled for follow up with diabetes clinic as
an outpatient. The patient has significant neuropathic pain in her
feet due to diabetic neuropathy , has been unable to obtain neurontin
from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ince Center</PHI> , pain currently managed on a PRN basis with occ
oxycodone at night.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You should take all of your medications as directed by your doctors.
It is very important to visit your doctors for follow up to make sure
that your diabetes , blood pressure , and heart failure are under
control. If you have additional trouble breathing or chest pain or any
other emergency , do not hesitate to return to the emergency room.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/29/2917</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old man with
ischemic cardiomyopathy , estimated EF
15-20% who presents with an 8-10 pound weight gain over the past
3-5 days , increased fatigue. Also reports increased shortness of
breath which has progressed over the past few months and notes that
he now gets shortness of breath after walking as few as 10-20
steps. He also complains of lightheadedness but denies chest pain ,
palpitations. He also complains of occasional sweats and chills
without nausea , diarrhea , constipation , melena , or bright red blood
per rectum. He reports that lately his blood sugars have been
lower than usual , in the 40s-80s. Denies orthopnea , PND , or lower
extremity edema. Denies dietary indiscretions or medical
noncompliance. However , there is a recent history of discontinuing
certain medications and the patient is unclear to which medications
he should actually be taking at this point.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in 1979 and 1985 ,
status post three-vessel CABG in 1987 , ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
estimated ejection fraction 15-20% , cardiac cirrhosis ,
hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis , gallstones , irritable bowel
syndrome , psoriasis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Torsemide , Synthroid 100 mcg p.o.q.d.;
Lantus 98 units subcu q. a.m.; potassium

Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Aldactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. Per patient
his digoxin , Captopril and Aldactone have been on hold. Apparently
these were held after a clinic visit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/11/17</PHI> via Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Youmans.</PHI>
when the patient was complaining of orthostatic symptoms and his
torsemide was held over the past five days prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.8 , heart rate
72 , blood pressure 91/63 , breathing 95% on
room air. GENERAL: This is a comfortable , pleasant gentleman in
no acute distress. Alert and oriented x 3. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP estimated at 12 cm/water. LUNGS: Decreased
breath sounds at bases , otherwise clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No heart
sounds. No murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Warm , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.2 , troponin-I 0.06.
Electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 67 beats/minute , first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , right bundle branch block. Q
waves in II , III and AVF consistent with old inferior infarct. All
these findings unchanged from the prior EKG in <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/06.</PHI>
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. VOLUME OVERLOAD.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient on admission was
clinically volume overloaded. He was diuresed
with torsemide IV boluses with good response. He was diuresing two
liters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as
spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. However , his clinical volume status
were difficult to assess and accordingly on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/23/17</PHI> he underwent
right heart catheterization and tailored therapy. By report his
right atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , his
wedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37
indicating that he still has substantial volume overload. On
therapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease his
systemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance with
success with low doses of Captopril. His PA catheter was
discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/26/17.</PHI> He has continued to be diuresed with
torsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. He should
be at or near euvolemia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/29/17</PHI> and he was discharged on a
diuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone
25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Ischemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital
admission.
Rhythm: Electrocardiogram with first degree AV block. The patient
was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. No
evidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. No further workup
was pursued from a rhythm standpoint.
2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. It is
unclear how this came to be but at some point in the past his
Synthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.
He had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. When
he was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Genevieve.</PHI> , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and
titrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and
there was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would
precipitate angina. On admission his TSH was 50 and after some
discussion with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Genevieve.</PHI> his Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg
p.o.q.d. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/28/17</PHI> an endocrine consult was requested because on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/26/17</PHI> his repeat TSH of 75.8 , T4 of 6.5 and a THBR of 1.10.
Endocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg
p.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25
mcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly
titrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.
Further management of his hypothyroidism could be done on an
outpatient basis.
The patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes
maintained on insulin. His insulin doses had been titrated
downwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low
fingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while
in the hospital. He required only 60 units of Lantus insulin q.
a.m. He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q.
a.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards
by his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Genevieve.</PHI>
3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and
during this admission he was maintained on his outpatient
medications of Prozac and Restoril. His Prozac dose was titrated
upwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. He
was discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. No further
psychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during his
inpatient stay. His mood remained stable during this admission.
4 ) Renal: The patient's creatinine was monitored throughout his
hospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. No
further renal evaluation or intervention was required during this
hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/29/17</PHI> on e
following medications: spironolactone 25
mg p.o.q.d.; Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; simvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Lantus insulin 60 units
subcu q. a.m.; Humalog insulin 10 units subcu q. a.m. and q. p.m.;
K-Dur 40 mEq p.o.q.d.; Synthroid 150 mcg p.o.q.d.; Prozac 60 mg
p.o. q. a.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o.q.d.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , DIABETES MELLITUS ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DEPRESSION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , VOLUME OVERLOAD ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DIABETES MELLITUS , DEPRESSION.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition afebrile on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/29/17</PHI> without
shortness of breath , without chest pain , without any complaints.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with VNA arranged to visit him
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/30/17</PHI> for the first time to monitor his weight ,
to monitor his electrolytes and to monitor his blood sugars and to
adjust his insulin and diuretic dose as needed.
FOLLOWUP: He was instructed to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Youmans.</PHI> in
1-3 weeks and to follow up with his outpatient
endocrinologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Genevieve.</PHI> , in 1-2 weeks. Physical therapy was also
arranged for home physical therapy to begin after discharge.

He denies smoking history and he denies ethanol abuse. REVIEW OF
SYSTEMS: Negative for dyspnea on exertion , shortness of breath ,
palpitations , or anginal like symptoms. He does get bilateral leg
edema. He has not had any evidence of neuropathy , retinopathy , or
nephropathies associated with his diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-developed 44 year old male who appears
stated age. HEENT: Demonstrated pupils to
be equal and reactive , extraocular muscles intact , and oropharynx
was clear. NECK: Supple with full painless range of motion and
there was no goiter , adenopathy , or jugular venous distention.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Demonstrated a regular
rate and rhythm without significant murmur , rub , or thrill.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-obese , and non-tender without evidence of
hepatosplenomegaly. ORTHOPEDIC: Demonstrated that he had
approximately 10 degrees of dorsiflexion , 10 degrees of plantar
flexion with very limited subtalar motion , good mid foot motion but
with some pain on motion of the mid foot. There was pain during
movement of his tibiotalar joint. Specifically , there was little
pain with motion of the subtalar joint or the mid foot. He had
good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses , he had normal
sensation at the first dorsal web space , dorsum , and plantar
aspects of the foot , and the hindfoot appeared to be in neutral
position. There did not appear to be any supination or pronation
deformities. He had full painless range of motion at the hip and
at the knee on the ipsilateral side.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: X-Rays demonstrated marked degenerative
joint disease with a complete obliteration
of the articular joint space in the lateral half of the joint.
There were also some degenerative changes in the mid foot. His
pre-operative laboratory evaluation demonstrated EKG with normal
sinus rhythm and no evidence of ischemic changes , glucose was 133 ,
BUN was 35 , creatinine 1.2 , potassium of 4.2 , liver function tests
were entirely within normal limits , hematocrit was 42.8 , white
blood cell count was 9 , and the PT and PTT were 11.6 and 28.2
respectively. The patient's urinalysis was entirely clear for
bacteria and negative for glucose and ketones.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted as a same day surgery
candidate with traumatic arthritis at the right
tibiotalar joint and he underwent tibiotalar fusion with
cross-cannulated AO screws and local bone graft. The procedure
involved partial fibulectomy as well as a partial osteotomy of the
medial malleolus. The position of the ankle at the end of the
procedure was neutral dorsiflexion , plantar flexion , and neutral
varus/valgus. He had a general endotracheal anesthetic for failed
sciatic nerve block , estimated blood loss was 200 cc , and total
tourniquet time was 1 hour and 57 minutes. He received 2500 cc of
crystalloid intraoperatively and he tolerated the procedure well.
Post-operatively , his motor and sensory examinations were intact
with regard to deep and superficial peroneal and posterior tibialis
nerves. His Hemovac put out a total of 150 cc and was removed on
post-operative day number one. He initially was kept in a
posterior splint with anterior wings. This was changed on
post-operative day two. The wound appeared to be clean and dry and
he was placed in a short-leg fiberglass cast since there was little
swelling apparent. He had an X-Ray after placement of the cast and
the position of the ankle looked to be in neutral position and
neutral varus/valgus. He was cleared by Physical Therapy
ambulatory , non-weight bearing , with use of crutches. He did not
have any difficulties with the cast , no significant swelling , and
was discharged on post-operative day three. The patient did have
some elevated temperatures which were attributed to atelectasis and
was encouraged to cough and deep breath.
DISPOSITION: Patient will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jimmy Varney.</PHI> in
approximately three weeks at which time the cast will
be changed and stitches removed. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The
medications that he was admitted on with the addition of Vicodan

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) UNSTABLE ANGINA
( 2 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
( 3 ) DIABETES MELLITUS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old female
with history of coronary artery
disease who presented with unstable angina. The patient's cardiac
risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , and
post-menopausal. She presented to an outside hospital in 1992 with
substernal chest pain. A cardiac catheterization at that time
revealed an right coronary artery with diffuse disease , moderate to
severe proximal left anterior descending artery lesion at diagonal
1 , moderate mid- left anterior descending artery lesion , and a
tight left circumflex. She underwent a PTCA of the left circumflex
artery with improvement. She was well until approximately one year
ago when she began having exertional chest pain. Her chest pain
has been worsening over the past several months and has been
occurring with less and less exertion. She was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>
of 1996 for chest pain and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
An exercise Thallium test was negative. She was well until <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI>
of 1997 when she again developed exertional chest pain. She said
that the chest pain was substernal. It had no radiation and no
nausea or vomiting and no diaphoresis. She had an exercise test on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">10/3/12</PHI> where she was only able to exercise for three minutes and
stopped secondary to shortness of breath. She was scheduled for an
elective catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/7/12</PHI> but her chest pain has been
slowly worsening over the past couple of months. She reports a
history of exertional chest pain at only one-half block. Normally
her chest pain was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. On
the evening prior to admission she woke up at 3 a.m. with severe
substernal chest pain. She had no relief with three sublingual
nitroglycerin and , therefore , presented to the emergency room.
In the emergency room she was made pain-free with IV nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as above. Diabetes
mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , and Metformin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room
department with chest pain but became pain-free
with sublingual nitroglycerin. The heparin was started in the
emergency room and the patient was given aspirin. The patient's
admission ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with no changes from
her previous ECG.
During the first several days of admission the patient began
complaining of some left chest pain but , on further questioning ,
the pain was under her left breast and radiating to her right back
and she was tender to palpation. Examination under the left breast
revealed three to four vesicles on an erythematous base felt to be
consistent with zoster. The patient was therefore started on
Famvir with some improvement of the pain and the lesion. In
addition to the superficial chest pain the patient did have some
chest pain which was felt to be cardiac in origin although she did
not have any ECG changes. She was continued on nitroglycerin and
heparin and her Lopressor was increased as tolerated.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23/12.</PHI>
Although the final catheterization report is not available yet , the
catheterization showed three vessel disease with normal left
ventricular function. It was felt that the patient needed to go
for coronary artery bypass graft but , due to the fact that she had
the herpes zoster under her left breast , it was decided to wait to
do the coronary artery bypass graft until her zoster had improved.
Therefore the patient was discharged to home and will undergo
coronary artery bypass graft in several weeks. Prior to discharge
the patient was seen by surgery and anesthesia for her preoperative
workup. There were no complications.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
26 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Lopressor 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q5m times three ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q4h p.r.n.
pain , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , Famciclovir 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. times 7
days. FOLLOWUP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">J. Christa</PHI>
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/31/12</PHI> and will follow-up with cardiac surgery.

4. SECOND DEGREE AV BLOCK.
5. OBESITY.
PROCEDURE:
1. Chest x-ray.
2. Dobutamine MIBI.
3. Echocardiogram.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year-old woman
with a history of hypertension ,
asthma , congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease who
has left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular dysfunction.
She presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> emergency room
department with two weeks of cough and two days of multiple
episodes of emesis and diarrhea. The review of systems was
otherwise negative.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> of 2000 showed mild to moderate
left ventricular dysfunction , septal apical hypokinesis , and
abnormal septal motion. Coronary artery disease. Dobutamine MIBI
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> of 2000 showed small fixed apical inferior defect , mild
ischemia in the lateral wall. Hypertension. Asthma. Morbid
obesity. Hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS: Atrovent , Flovent , Serevent , Vioxx , Zocor , Lopressor ,
Lasix , Losartan , aspirin , nitroglycerin.
ALLERGIES: Lisinopril.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with two daughters and granddaughter.
Never smoked. No alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate
120 , blood pressure 215/91 , respiratory rate
22 , oxygen saturation 93% on room air. The physical examination is
notable for morbid obesity. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema.
LABORATORY DATA: WBC 7 , hematocrit 45.5 , platelet count 211 , 000.
Chem-7 within normal limits. ECG: No acute
changes. Chest x-ray: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
SUMMARY: This is a 62 year-old woman admitted with two weeks of
dry cough , malaise , and resolving gastrointestinal
symptoms suspicious for a slowly resolving viral infection coupled
with mild congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction while in the hospital. The
patient had multiple nocturnal episodes of bradycardia and second
degree heart block with occasional irregular PR intervals. These
episodes were mostly asymptomatic although she did suffer one
episode of flash pulmonary edema on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/2/17.</PHI> Echocardiogram was
done in the hospital which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with
no wall motion abnormalities and mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Dobutamine MIBI was also performed and this showed no
ischemia. The electrophysiology service was consulted and they
determined that the patient was not a candidate for pacing. While
she was in the hospital , the patient enjoyed excellent diuresis on
IV Torsemide and was discharged on p.o. Lasix.
Pulmonary: The patient had a persistent cough which improved with
diuresis and with a five day course of levofloxacin to treat
possible bacterial bronchitis. Nocturnal oxygen saturation monitor
revealed likely obstructive sleep apnea with episodic desaturations
to as low as 57%. These episodes of desaturation were coupled with
second degree AV block as mentioned above. The patient was started
on C-PAP , however , she did not tolerate and refused to use as outpatient.
Gastrointestinal: The patient's nausea and vomiting resolved
following admission.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/14/2912</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36 year-old male who
presented with chest pain for one
and one-half hours. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> , 1989 , he developed chest pain and
suffered an inferior myocardial infarction. He had an angioplasty
of his right coronary artery performed at that time. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> ,
1989 , he had more chest pain. Cardiac catheterization indicated
left anterior descending artery lesion. An angioplasty was
attempted and he had abrupt left anterior descending artery
closure , requiring emergent single vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting. He did well until <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 1996 , when he had more
angina. Cardiac catheterization showed a high grade left
circumflex lesion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
of the left circumflex was successful. At that time , his cardiac
catheterization also showed that his saphenous vein to left
anterior descending artery graft was patent. His ejection fraction
was 68% by left ventriculogram at that time. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 1996 , he
had more chest pain and his cardiac catheterization showed no
significant change compared to his <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 1996 , cardiac
catheterization. One week prior to admission , the patient had
chest pain , which was quickly relieved by one sublingual
nitroglycerin. On the day of admission , while resting , he
developed anterior chest pressure with radiation to his neck ,
associated with some lightheadedness and nausea. There was no
diaphoresis or dyspnea. He took three sublingual nitroglycerin
with minimal relief. He came to the Emergency Room and his pain
resolved after one inch of nitroglycerin paste , 2 milligrams of
intravenous morphine , 325 milligrams of aspirin and supplemental
oxygen. The total duration of his pain was one and one-half hours.
He was then admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit.
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were Atenolol 100
milligrams b.i.d.; Cardizem 60 milligrams p.o.
b.i.d.; pravastatin 20 milligrams p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams
q.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis C; hypercholesterolemia;
hypertension; coronary artery disease with
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1989.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denied recent orthopnea or PND.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was comfortable and pleasant.
Temperature was 97.8. Blood pressure
124/68. Heart rate 64. Respiratory rate 18. Oxygen saturation
96% on room air. Neck without jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. No murmurs.
Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities no cyanosis ,
clubbing or edema. Rectal occult blood negative.
Chest x-ray was negative by report. Electrocardiogram with pain
showed normal sinus rhythm at 61. Axis was 0. There was no
significant change compared to a <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> , 1997 , electrocardiogram. His
laboratory studies were notable for a CPK of 103. Liver function
tests were within normal limits. Troponin was 0.0. Hematocrit was
40.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit
with chest pain. He underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol with negative serial CPKs. He had
no events on cardiac monitor. He had no further episodes of chest
pain while in the hospital. On hospital day number two , he
underwent an exercise test. It was a standard Bruce protocol and
he exercised for 9 minutes 1 second , stopping secondary to leg
fatigue. He had no chest pain. His peak heart rate was 131. Peak
blood pressure was 200/100 with no electrocardiographic changes.
His test was read as showing no evidence of ischemia. The patient
was then discharged to home. There were no medication changes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Same as on admission.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA.
2 ) HISTORY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
3 ) NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
4 ) RECENT DIAGNOSIS OF SLEEP APNEA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year-old male
whose past medical history is
significant for myocardial infarction in 1996 without residual
angina , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and a recent
diagnosis of sleep apnea. He was in his usual state of health
until three days prior to admission when he began to develop a
cough productive occasionally of yellow sputum , dyspnea on exertion
and temperatures to 102 degrees. One day prior to admission , he
went to his primary healthcare provider where he was diagnosed with
pneumonia and given Erythromycin and Ciprofloxacin without
improvement. The following day , he went back to his primary care
provider and was given cough syrup with Codeine , but without relief
and through the course of that day , he developed increasing
shortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented to
the emergency room. In the emergency room , he had a temperature of
100 degrees with room air oxygen saturations between 90% and 95%.
He was cultured and a chest x-ray was taken which showed a right
middle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he was admitted with a
community acquired pneumonia resistant to outpatient management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 100.1 degrees ,
blood pressure 130/80 , heart rate 60 , oxygen
saturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula. His HEENT
examination was unremarkable. His lung examination revealed
rhonchorous breath sounds throughout with decreased breath sounds
at his bases , right greater than left. He also had diffuse
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. His cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs , gallops
or rubs. The abdominal examination was benign. His extremities
revealed no edema. His neurological examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY: His laboratory studies were notable for a chem-7 that
was within normal limits. His CBC revealed a white
blood cell count of 7.3 with a hematocrit of 33.5 and a platelet
count of 130. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 with left
atrial enlargement. There were no ischemic changes. His chest
x-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates bilaterally with a more focal
area of consolidation in the right middle lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apnea
who was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failed
outpatient management. He was initially started on intravenous
Cefuroxime and Azithromycin for likely community acquired bacterial
pathogens and atypical organisms. He was cultured and sputums were
obtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout his
hospital course. On hospital day number two , he developed
increasing shortness of breath with oxygen saturations of roughly
86% on six liters. At this time , his lung examination was notable
for marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with
decreased air movements. The rest of his examination at this time
including the cardiac examination was unremarkable. This event was
felt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he was
treated with numerous Albuterol nebulizers and intravenous Lasix on
which his oxygenation gradually improved to 96% on six liters.
Because of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhaps
worsening pneumonia , he was at this time switched to Legionella
doses of Azithromycin and was started on aggressive nebulizer
treatments. However , at this time , the possibility of flash
pulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. However ,
it was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant for
an episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure was
at baseline. His heart rate was at 70 and he had not become
obviously fluid overloaded. Nonetheless , he received a cardiac
work-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for a
myocardial infarction and the following day , he received an
echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% with
apical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis. There was no marked
left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore , it was thought unlikely
that flash pulmonary edema had significantly contributed to his
hypoxia and he was subsequently treated solely for severe community
acquired pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component. He was
therefore continued on Cefuroxime and Azithromycin with gradual
resolution of his fevers and a significant improvement in his air
movement and his pulmonary examination. Two weeks prior to this
admission , he was started on a Prednisone taper and subsequent
underwent marked improvement in his air movement and in the degree
of bronchospasm. Therefore , he was discharged home on the
following medications.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Biaxin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times two
day to complete a long course for
atypical coverage. 2 ) Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
shortness of breath. 3 ) Enteric coated aspirin. 4 ) Glyburide 5
mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6 ) Prednisone
taper. 7 ) Timoptic one drop o.u. q. PM. 8 ) Cardura one p.o. q.
day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
provider. We have also asked him to follow-up on two
laboratory abnormalities which came back through his
hospitalization and he was noted to have a microcytic anemia and he
had iron studies sent which revealed an iron of 16 and a TIBC of
241. His primary care provider is aware of this and will follow-up
on this as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.

Ischemia: No evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.
Elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possibly
secondary to NSTEMI prior to admission versus demand. The
patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor , which were titrated to effect. The patient was
started on a statin and continued on Niaspan , left heart cath
revealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% LAD
stenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% RCA and 100%
effused LIMA graft to circumflex and a 100% effused SVG graft to
LAD. The patient is now status post stenting the OM V1 and LAD.
The patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath has
improved.
Pump: EF 15% on repeat echo with severe MR. The patient was
continued on spironolactone. The patient continued to be
diuresed initially and is now euvolemic. He will need a repeat
echo in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction and
determine the utility of an AICD placement.
Rhythm: We held verapamil secondary to double AV nodal blockade.
However , with the patient's history of widened QRS and multiple
PVCs and SVT , the patient will follow up with EP to assess the
utility of AICD.
2. Respiratory: The patient has no acute issues. Shortness of
breath has improved. Continues to complain of residual shortness
of breath while lying flat on his left side.
3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable at baseline. We will
closely follow status post chat. The patient was pretreated with
bicarbonate and Mucomyst. Creatinine remained stable.
4. GI: LFTs are mildly increased likely secondary to right
heart failure.
5. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. It
trended down status post cath likely secondary to blood loss
given the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to
38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. Despite patient
remaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence of
hematoma , the patient underwent a CT scan , which was negative.
His hematocrit was stabilized. He was not transfused , as he was
asymptomatic and recently revascularized. The patient was noted
to be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thus
will need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. The patient
continues his heparin-bridged Coumadin with a goal of INR 2 to 3.
In addition , the patient suffers from long-term
thrombocytopenia. His platelet count was 113 on admission.
Review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admission
to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vallejo , Voigt Mollie Izzo Woodrow</PHI> as well as on presentation to outside hospital prior
to heparinization , thus low suspicion for HIT. The patient's
platelet level remained stable. He should consider outpatient
evaluation by Hematology.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes on oral
hypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. The patient
was controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oral
hypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. A1c was within normal
limits.
7. ID: No acute issues.
8. Psych: History of anxiety , on Paxil and Ativan.
9. FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking.
He was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,
which he tolerated well. He will be discharged with a
prescription for the nicotine patch as well.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow up with PCP and
Cardiology as well as EP. Patient encouraged to check his daily
weights and report a weight increase of more than 2 pounds daily
or 3 pounds a week to his PCP. The patient will also follow up
with INR checks as an outpatient.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Dear Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hooper , Lesa S.</PHI> , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you had a heart attack because your
previous stent was occluded. The interventional cardiologist restented
this vessel in the catheterization lab. Please , it is crucial that you
continue taking your medications as instructed , especially ASPIRIN and
PLAVIX. Please take these medications every day until instructed
otherwise by your doctors. Please weigh yourself daily and keep
records of your weight. If you experience worsening shortness of breath
with exertion or at rest , have chest pain , dizziness , fainting , or
swelling , please call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Titrate Coumadin to goal INR 2-3.
2. ) Pt likely needs CPAP machine at home ( failed sleep study )
3. ) Titrate ACEi ( was previously on ARB ) as tolerated , BB ( now on Toprol
XL 200 , instead of atenolol 25 )
4. ) Likely needs re-eval of LV fxn in 6-8 meeks , AICD/PPM , consider
aldosterone antagonist.

DATE OF DISCHARGE: To be determined.
SERVICE: Heart Failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Referred by primary care physician for
increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old male with COPD , CABG ,
ischemic cardiomyopathy , hypertension , CRI , CAD , atrial
fibrillation , distant history of DVT , morbid obesity , presents
with three weeks of increased dyspnea on exertion despite an
increase in his Lasix dose from 80 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. He has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. He
denies PND , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). He
had productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with some
initial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuous
decline since then. He can do his activities of daily living ,
but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in his
wheelchair. He went to his primary care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yelverton Alicia</PHI> who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed a
desaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the Heart
Failure Service for diuresis and optimization.

1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Morbid obesity.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline 1.6 to 1.9 ).
4. Gynecomastia.
5. Peripheral vascular disease.
6. Coronary artery disease.
7. Diabetes 2.
8. Venous stasis ulcer.
9. COPD.
10. Two-vessel CABG in 1995.

the inferior wall , right ventricular function was moderately
reduced , trace aortic insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation ,
mild tricuspid regurgitation , PASP of 36 plus right atrial
pressure.
20. Hemoglobin A1c on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/29/19</PHI> was 5.6.
ALLERGIES: Linezolid.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( increased from 120 mg b.i.d. on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">11/22/19</PHI> ).
2. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/22/19.</PHI>
3. Toprol-XL 12.5 mg p.o. q. day.

7. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.
The following medications have been stopped recently:
1. ACE inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).
2. Zocor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure
140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on
2 liters. The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but
had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. His JVP was 13
to 14 cm. He had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way up
his lungs. Heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left upper
sternal border murmur. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , nondistended ,
normoactive bowel sounds. He had a left below the knee
amputation , which was warm and clean. Right leg was fully
intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from
the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no
palpable pulses.
LABORATORIES: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,
bicarbonate 30 , BUN 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. BNP was
473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. White blood cell count 6.2 ,
hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , INR 3.0 , PTT 68.9. Chest
x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiac
silhouette. EKG left bundle-branch block with no peaked T waves ,
normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversion in I , L , V5 , V6 ( which
represent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,
consistent with LVH although it does not meet formal LVH
criteria ).
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but
given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was
negative.
b. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. His
admission weight was 130 kg. He was started on IV Lasix for
diuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to
3 liters negative per day. He had a right heart catheterization
which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure
of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting
high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. Cardiac
output was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was
174. Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume
overloaded and was diuresed further. At the time of this
dictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on
admission.
From the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on
hydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these were
titrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than
120.
c. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept
on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was being
prepped for his right heart cath. He is now being restarted on
Coumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3.
2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible
causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and
his underlying COPD and body habitus. An arterial blood gas was
done with 2 liters nasal cannula on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/4/19</PHI> and this showed pH
of 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. This is
on 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. Compared
to his prior ABG in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbon
dioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. This
suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. Therefore , he
was started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense of
comfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. At this point , he
will be sent home on home BiPAP.
3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral
effusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because
the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be
improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.
4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening from
his lymphedema. Dermatology was consulted for proper care of his
legs. They were initially concerned that there could have been a
superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on
levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant
clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin
was discontinued after two days. Dermatology made specific
recommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength
Dakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by
betamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day.
There is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the
patient's nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy for
concern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell
carcinoma. This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with
atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. This
was potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell
carcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive
diagnosis. Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.
5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine
output into his Foley. Initially , this was dark red; however ,
this lightened significantly. There are also some clots evident.
The Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his
own; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it
appears to have lightened up. Further followup will be required
likely with Urology as an outpatient.
6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which
is well controlled after his recent weight loss. He was
maintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.
7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary
to his diabetes mellitus. We avoided contrast dye. The
patient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis
process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10/19.</PHI>

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16/2915</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old male with
mitral regurgitation and a history of
congestive heart failure , who presents for cardiac catheterization
and a coronary artery bypass graft. He has a history of severe
coronary artery disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
He is status post multiple previous myocardial infarctions and
presents with dyspnea on exertion over the last several months.
However , he denies any frank chest pain. The patient's cardiac
workup revealed four vessel coronary artery disease and severe
mitral regurgitation. He is preoperatively admitted to the
cardiology service for surgical planning for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;
osteomyelitis; anemia; right 5th and left
third toe amputation; peripheral vascular disease; anemia; chronic
renal insufficiency; status post laminectomy; tobacco and alcohol
use.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin , Lasix , Accupril , Digoxin , Isordil , and
aspirin.
ALLERGIES: To fish , which causes swelling.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Spanish-speaking male in no acute
distress. NECK: No carotid bruits. LUNGS:
Crackles at the bases bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the axilla , with a displaced of PMI. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
non-tender. EXTREMITIES: The femoral pulses are palpable
bilaterally , however , there were no palpable distal pulses. There
was no evidence of any significant varicosities. The left shin is
significant for two small eschars with a minimal rim of erythema.
His lower extremity is consistent with chronic vascular disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for surgical planning.
Previous echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 25-30% , a dilated left atrial size , 4+ MR , and moderate
TR. There was also severe hypokinesis of the inferior posterior
wall of left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization performed on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3/15</PHI> showed four vessel disease. Follow-up ABI studies were
stable with the right at 0.68 and the left at 1.61. Carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant carotid disease to
warrant surgical evaluation.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/05/15</PHI> , the patient was taken to the operating room , where
quadruple coronary artery bypass graft was performed , as well as a
mitral valve repair with a #26 posterior Cosgrove annuloplasty
band. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
to the cardiac surgery ICU.
Postoperatively , the patient's course was significant for acute and
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a low ejection
fraction , congestive heart failure , and volume overload. The
patient was weaned off of epinephrine and diuresed accordingly. He
was subsequently transferred to the stepdown unit after several
days in the ICU. He continued to progress well with the additional
diuresis. His chest tubes and wires were removed without
difficulty. Radiographs showed improvement in bilateral pulmonary
edema.
On the day of discharge , the patient was stable with stable vital
signs. He was afebrile , with no significant leukocytosis. His
renal function had returned to his baseline of around 2.0.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) captopril
25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 3 ) Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/30/2916</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. LEFT FRONTAL LOBE MENINGIOMA.
3. DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">XJWUOM</PHI> is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">90yo</PHI> woman with
a history of hypertension , prior
atrial fibrillation , who presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Patience Clinic</PHI> on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/19/16</PHI> with shortness of breath and some chest pain lasting
several hours at home. She was brought in by her great
granddaughter and found to have ST segment elevations inferiorly on
an electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.
At that point she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI>
for emergent catheterization. In the emergency room she was
treated with Lasix , Lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin and
heparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac
catheterization showed a right dominant system with no left main
disease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percent
lesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posterior
descending coronary artery stenosis. The posterior descending
coronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residual
stenosis of 0 percent. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications and was then transferred to the intensive
care unit for further monitoring. On admission to the coronary
care unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness of
breath , and no chest pain. She was noted to have a right groin
hematoma for which pressure was held.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation , history
of pulmonary edema , left frontal lobe
meningioma as documented by MRI of the brain in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q day , Zestril 10 mg per day , Isordil 10
mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure
140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 liters
of oxygen. GENERAL: Awake , alert and oriented in no acute
distress. Oropharynx is clear. Crackles present bilaterally
throughout both lung fields. CARDIAC: Regular , rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. No radiation to the neck. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No edema. 2
plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologic
status intact. Nonfocal exam.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 13.6 ,
hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 100 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 37 ,
creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. PT was 11 , PTT 23 , INR 0.88. CK
number one is 216 with no MB fraction done prior to transfer. CK
number two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , MB 310 , troponin
3.49.
Electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm at
the time pre-catheterization. Rate of 75. Two millimeter ST
segment elevation in leads II , III and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was transferred
to the coronary care unit after cardiac
catheterization and right coronary artery stent for further
management. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK
was 2577 with a MB fraction of 310. Troponin on admission was
3.49. She was placed on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zestril and
simvastatin. Two days after this initial catheterization on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/21/16</PHI> , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be to
diastolic dysfunction. This occurred in the context of her having
a systolic blood pressure of 200. She was then transferred back to
the coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints of
chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the T
waves laterally. Her CKs continued to trend down however due to
the concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin and
brought back to the catheterization laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/23/16</PHI> for
stenting of the left circumflex lesion. Since the second stent she
continued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. Her CKs
continued to trend down. An echocardiogram was done which showed
an ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,
moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was managed with aspirin , Plavix with plans to keep her on this
for one month , Zocor and Lopressor. Due to a rising creatinine
after the second catheterization her Zestril has been stopped and
she has been started on hydralazine until her creatinine
normalizes.
2. Renal: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 which
increased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. The etiology is
deemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. Her creatinine is now
improving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. This should be
followed and her Zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and the
hydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.
Electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.
3. Pulmonary: No active issues currently. She did have an
episode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high blood
pressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. The goal is to
control the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.
There is no need for diuresis.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.
She did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. She was
transfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 and
for the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at
34. The patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is on
Prilosec 20 mg q day.
5. Psychiatry/neurologic: The patient was noted to sun down at
night with episodes of confusion and agitation. A psychiatry
consult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior was
consistent with dementia and recommended starting Zyprexa. The
patient was placed on standing Zyprexa 5 mg at night and continued
to improve on this medication. She had no episodes of agitation
after being transferred to the floor. In addition she has a
history of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with a
meningioma. This has been noted on CT and MRI scans done in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI>
of 2000. Neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgery
would not be a good option for this patient , in addition they did
not feel that the mass was responsible for any mental status
changes.
6. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of a positive
RPR which has not been treated previously. She is now being
treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units
times three injections. She has one injection pending which is due
on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/07/16.</PHI> In addition she has had a negative lumbar puncture
for neurologic syphilis.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is to be discharged to the
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Upshur Isenberg Garth</PHI> with
eventual plans to return to home.
She will also follow up with a new primary care provider , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Quinlan Joesph</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nakia Y.E. Corrine Healthcare</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/3/16.</PHI>

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. HYPETENSION
3. DYSPEPSIA
4. ADJUSTMENT DISORDER WITH ANXIETY
ID/CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 70 year old white female
status post non Q wave MI in <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-07</PHI> , with
thrombolytic therapy and cardiac risk factors of long standing
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and history of tobacco use , who
presents upon transfer from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nancy Clinic</PHI> with chief
complaint of post MI unstable angina.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has the history of
long standing hypertension and has had
chest pain in the past including at least one previous episode of
rule out MI. She was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-11-07</PHI> , to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Yadon Clinic</PHI> with
signs and symptoms consistent with acute MI , and apparently
received salvage therapy with IV Streptokinase and TPA. Limited
records are available from this hospitalization. The patient
apparently had a submax exercise tolerance test before discharge
which is reportedly unremarkable. Upon discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Yadon Clinic</PHI> the patient additionally did well and then had three
episodes of typical substernal chest pain with minimal exertion
that were relieved with SL Nitroglycerin.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-26-07</PHI> , the patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nancy Clinic</PHI> with an
episode of heavy substernal chest pressure that was similar in
quality to her previous MI. This pain was not relieved with SL
Nitroglycerin. There was no associated shortness of breath ,
nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis. In the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nelle Quivers*Perkins#</PHI> ER , she was
treated with SL and topical nitrates with subsequent relief of her
chest pain. Her presentation was also significant for a chest
x-ray consistent with interstitial edema. Otherwise , her
examination was unremarkable and her EKG showed no worrisome
ischemic changes. She ruled out for MI and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-27-07</PHI> , was
transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> on IV Heparin , IV Nitroglycerin , beta blockade
and aspirin. At the time of her admission , the patient was without
chest pain and denied other associated symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8-07</PHI> , as above; long standing hypertension ,
75 pack year history of cigarette smoking , hypercholesterolemia ,
chronic dyspepsia , history of positive PPD with normal chest x-ray ,
remote history of breast cancer. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status
post cholecystectomy , status post appendectomy , status post renal
stone removal , status post C. section x 3 , status post breast
lumpectomy. MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: IV Nitroglycerin at 140
micrograms per minute , IV Heparin drip , Lopressor , aspirin one a
day. ALLERGIES: Penicillin which causes anaphylaxis. FAMILY
HISTORY: Negative for premature cardiac disease , negative for
diabetes mellitus. SOCIAL HISTORY: Most significant for her
husband's recent diagnosis of GI malignancy which will require
inpatient admission at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> and the recent death of a brother-in-law
at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese white female in no
apparent distress , pleasant and cooperative.
The vital signs were temp 97.8 , pulse 48 , BP 140/60 , respirations
16 with O2 sat of 95% on O2 2 liters per minute. HEENT exam was
unremarkable. There were normal carotid upstrokes without bruit.
The chest exam showed bibasilar rales right greater than left but
otherwise the lungs were clear to auscultation , no wheezing. CV
exam showed a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds ,
normal S1 and S2 , question of S4 , no appreciable murmurs. The
abdomen was obese , soft with normoactive bowel sounds. There were
previous surgical scars. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly was
noted. There were normal femoral and distal pulses , no peripheral
edema , no peripheral bruits. Neuro exam was unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA: The admission labs showed hematocrit 34.2 , WBC
6.7 , platelets 159 , 000 , PTT 50.0 on IV Heparin.
Urinalysis was essentially within normal limits. Glucose was 110 ,
BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 106 and
bicarb 29. LFT's were all within normal limits. Admission CK was
32 , albumin 3.9 , magnesium 2.0 , uric acid 6.2 , cholesterol 186. The
chest x-ray was unavailable. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at a
rate of 50 , first degree AV block axis +60 , ST elevation in leads
V2-V4 , poor R wave progression leads V1-V3.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient did well over the first 24 hours of
admission. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-29</PHI> , the patient went to cardiac
cath. Angiogram showed 50% mid circumflex , 60% mid left anterior
descending and only luminal irregularities in the right RCA ,
anterior wall hypokinesis but overall good LV systolic function
with an EF of approximately 72%. Average pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 20 and right atrial pressure 9. Cardiac output was
4.5 with cardiac index of 2.5. Careful review of the cath films
showed no hemodynamically significant lesions felt to be
responsible for the patient's chest pain. Echo performed on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">9-28-07</PHI> , showed left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal LV
systolic function , estimated EF of 50-55% , inferior posterior
hypokinesis , and trace of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation. There
was mild right ventricular hypertrophy and normal estimated
pulmonary artery pressure.
Postcatheterization , the patient showed mild hypertension which was
treated by the addition of a calcium channel blocker , and she was
also diuresed for fluid overload. Prior to discharge , she had two
additional episodes of chest pain that were low in intensity but
prolonged. Each of these required several Nitroglycerins and
antacids to be relieved. It was felt that the chest pain was
unlikely to be cardiac in origin and more likely represented either
GI symptomatology or an anxiety reaction. The patient repeatedly
expressed great concern over her husband's illness and understood
the possible connection between this and her chest pain. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10-2</PHI> ,
the patient underwent exercise treadmill test on the modified Bruce
protocol. She went 10 minutes and 30 seconds stopping secondary to
fatigue. Maximum heart rate was 108 , maximum BP 164 systolic , no
symptoms and no EKG changes , and the test was interpreted as
showing no evidence for ischemia. The patient was discharged to
home and is to follow up at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CHCE</PHI> .
COMPLICATIONS: None. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Nifedipine XL 90
mg po q am , Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg po q hs ,
aspirin 81 mg po q d , Serax 15 mg po q 6 h or q hs prn ,
Nitroglycerin 1/150 grain q 5 minutes x 3 SL prn chest pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. FOLLOW UP CARE: With her primary
care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yasmine Hansen</PHI> , and her cardiologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">J. Christa</PHI> , at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CHCE</PHI> .

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/25/2908</PHI>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 71 year old male with
coronary artery disease status post a
coronary artery bypass graft times two now presenting with chest
pain. He has had anginal type chest pain for years , never
associated with numbness , nausea , or sweating. Usually , they were
about four times a week but three months ago , he began getting pain
four to five times a day not with any exertion. He has had
decreased exercise tolerance. He takes one to four Nitroglycerin
tablets a day. The day of admission , he felt light headed and had
subsequent substernal chest pain. He took two Nitroglycerin with
no relief and called an ambulance where he had Morphine and
Nitroglycerin with relief. This pain was non-radiating but was
associated with nausea and urge to defecate. He was not quite sure
it was same as his inferior myocardial infarction which he had in
1973. In 1980 , he had a coronary artery bypass graft and again in
1982. Catheterization in 1987 revealed that the grafts were patent
with the native vessels occluded. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/05</PHI> , he had an echo with
overall contraction normal , there was inferior and posterior
hypokinesis , mild anteroseptal , and diastolic dimension was judged
to be possibly global. In 1993 , he had an exercise tolerance test
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. He went six
minutes and seven seconds with a pulse of 70 and a blood pressure
of 150/70 with typical chest pain. He had a thallium at the same
time and that showed mild non-transmural defect inferiorly with no
ischemia. Also on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/11/08</PHI> , he presented with a cough and had an
abnormal chest X-Ray. He was treated with antibiotics. He denies
any recent cough , fever , chills , or sources for infection. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , status
post a myocardial infarction in 1973 , a coronary artery bypass
graft in 1982 , he is status post a partial gastrectomy thirty years
ago , he had a recent upper respiratory infection in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/08</PHI> , benign
prostatic hypertrophy with four transurethral resection of the
prostate , the last being in 1990 , hypertension , pneumonia in 1976 ,
sigmoid diverticulosis , and benign polyps removed at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dionne Stanley Orth Clinic</PHI> CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Isordil Tembids four
times a day , Diltiazem 60 mg four times a day , Ativan 1 mg three
times a day , Persantine 50 three times a day , Carafate one q.a.m. ,
Aspirin , and Ativan 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ALLERGIES: He has no
known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former smoker , he
denies any use of tobacco or alcohol , he lives with his wife , and
patient is from <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</PHI> FAMILY HISTORY: Congestive heart disease
in his father , his mother had died at the age of 42 of cancer of
the stomach , and he has a sister and a maternal aunt who have heart
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was well-developed and well-nourished in
no acute distress with a temperature of 98 ,
pulse of 60 , respirations 16 , and blood pressure 130/70. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light , extraocular
movements were intact , and pharynx was benign. NECK: Supple.
CHEST: Without wheezes or rales of the right greater than the
left. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Examination showed
that he had a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs , the apex was normal , there was no jugular venous distention ,
and carotids were 2+ with no bruits. ABDOMEN: Had normal active
bowel sounds and was soft and non-tender with no hepatomegaly.
RECTAL: Examination was deferred. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was
completely intact.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray revealed that he was status
post a coronary artery bypass graft with
lower lobe infiltrates bilaterally and EKG showed a rate of 50 ,
axis of 0 , intervals were normal , he had early R waves , and he had
questionable ST elevation in V2 , II , III , and F. His creatinine
was 1.4 with a BUN of 24 , glucose of 106 , sodium 138 , potassium
4.3 , chloride 99 , and bicarbonate 31. He had 190 platelets ,
hematocrit of 41 , and a white count of 5.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was assessed as having possible chest
pain and was put on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol. The pain was said to be atypical but it was
considered best to rule him out. He was also started on
Ceftriaxone for a possible pneumonia. He had blood cultures times
two taken which subsequently came back normal and a PA and lateral
chest X-Ray , he did not have infiltrates so that was discontinued.
He went on to rule out for a myocardial infarction and he underwent
exercise thallium on which , on a modified Bruce protocol , he went
eight minutes with a heart rate of 93 , blood pressure 150/70 with
no ischemia but chest pain without episode of mild or reversible
defect , and an anterior transmural reversible defect. Patient was
told of his condition and was started on a beta blocker per
Cardiology. In the hospital , patient developed some episodes of
chest pain with EKG normal each time. His stomach had also felt
ascitic lately. Cardiology saw him and did not feel that the pain
was cardiac with a myocardial infarction. He was placed on p.o.
Pepcid for ascitic stomach. Patient tolerated his Inderal he was
started on well and went to 20 mg.

1. INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS FOR 30 YEARS.
2. HYPERLIPIDEMIA.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

CIRCUMFLEX AND THE OBTUSE MARGINAL ARTERIES IN 1997.
6. TOTAL BLINDNESS X2 YEARS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yoshizawa Karon</PHI> is a 63 year
old woman with cardiac risk factors
including hypertension , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus x30
years , elevated cholesterol , known coronary artery disease status
post MI , who presented with 1 1/2 hours of chest pain. This chest
pain began at approximately 9:30 a.m. while the patient was
awaiting her ride to the center for the blind , where she spends
most of her mornings and afternoon. The patient began as a dull
ache substernal in location , described as a squeezing sensation
similar to her past angina , but less strong than the angina she had
had last week before coming to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> . The
patient described this as 4/10 chest pain. She also had shortness
of breath , diaphoresis , and wrist tingling on the left. The
patient took one sublingual nitro at home with some relief , but the
pain came back as she walking around her home looking for her
hospital identification care. She had worsening of the pain with
exercise. She sat down and her visiting nurse gave her two more
sublingual nitroglycerin with some relief of pain and called the
ambulance. In the ambulance , the patient continued to have the
pain and she received one more sublingual nitroglycerin and nasal
cannula oxygen. The pain was gone upon arrival to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valladares &Woods; Arthur Carney.</PHI> In the Emergency Department , the patient was found to be
afebrile with heart rate in the high 90s , BP 200s/100s. EKG with
questionable changes compared to old , showing normal sinus rhythm
to leftward axis and LVH. For her elevated heart rate and blood
pressure , the patient received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 20 mg of
labetalol in the Emergency Department and was started on heparin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.d.; NPH 25 U subcu. q.a.m.;
Regular insulin 15 U subcu. q.a.m.; captopril 37.5 mg
p.o. t.i.d.; Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d.;
ECASA 325 mg p.o. q.d.; Adalat CC 30 mg p.o. q.a.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was born in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Rhode Island</PHI> and immigrated to
the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</PHI> in 1968. The patient formerly
worked as a nurses aide at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hyman Charles.</PHI> . The patient lives
with her son and his wife , and their four children. The patient
has never smoked and does not drink.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 73 , BP 93/51 ,
oxygen saturation 98% on room air , and was
afebrile when she arrived on the floor. GENERAL: The patient was
alert and in no acute distress , and as previously noted , the
patient is blind. HEENT: An atrophic right eye with two palpable
recoiled muscles in the upper and lower palpebral margin. Her left
eye is mobile , but has a clouded pupil area. She does not blink to
threat. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. NECK: Her
jugular venous pressure was not elevated. HEART: Regular rate and
rhythm , with audible S1 , S2 , no murmur , rubs , or gallops were
appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft , mildly obese , non-tender ,
non-distended. The patient had audible bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:
No clubbing or cyanosis. She has trace edema in the lower
extremities , good pulses bilaterally in her lower extremities and
in her upper extremities. NEURO: Grossly intact , except for her
visual exam. SKIN: No rashes , warm , and dry.
LABORATORY DATA: Initial labs when the patient arrived included a
normal Chem-7. CBC that was normal , including a
white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 41.3 , platelets 254 , with 52
polys , 33 lymphs , and 0 bands on her differential. Coags - PT
19.9 , INR 0.8. Initial CK 251 , initial troponin 1.26.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Initial questioning of the patient revealed that
she had actually been admitted less than two
weeks earlier with similar syndrome of chest pain , though as the
patient describes , worse two weeks previously. At that point , the
patient had had a modified Bruce protocol with duration of the test
5 minutes 12 seconds , with 63% of heart rate achieved. The patient
had stopped secondary to chest pain and had had ST-T wave segment
abnormalities , with 1 mm ST segment depressions in inferior leads
and angina. The test was interpreted as being highly predictive of
significant coronary disease. However , at that time , the patient
refused catheterization and decided on medical management for this
anginal pain. However , with the return of this pain and her return
admission to the hospital , the patient made the decision that she
would be catheterized and she was placed on this schedule. Other
initial interventions , other than what was done in the Emergency
Room , which included maximizing blood pressure and heart rate
management with Lopressor. The patient was continued on her daily
aspirin and Zocor. The patient was ruled out for a MI. The
patient's cholesterol and lipids were checked , and an initial
echocardiogram was also obtained on the patient. That echo done on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">11/19/14</PHI> in the morning revealed overall normal left ventricular
size with preserved systolic function , an estimated ejection
fraction of 60% , and hypokinesis of inferior posterior wall and
septum. The mitral valve was minimally thickened with minimal
mitral regurgitation. There was no significant aortic or tricuspid
valve regurgitation or dysfunction. There was normal right
ventricular size and function. There was no evidence of
pericardial effusion. The left ventricle was thought to be
moderate to severely hypertrophied. However , the inferior
posterior walls were less hypertrophied than other areas. The
patient had one episode of chest pain over the weekend as her cath
was planned for Monday morning. This chest pain occurred on
<PHI TYPE="DATE">11/19/14</PHI> , again of elevated blood pressure 200/107. It was
relieved by increasing her IV TNG drip to 7.5 mg , IV Lopressor , and
three sublingual nitroglycerins. The patient had no EKG changes ,
and had no other chest pain over the weekend. The patient was
continued on heparin , IV TNG , aspirin , and captopril. Over the
week , her Lopressor was increased to 37.5 mg t.i.d. for better beta
blockade. The patient also had her dose of NPH adjusted to half
her regular dose , as she was having low blood sugars.
The patient's catheterization ultimately was <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/19/14.</PHI> Findings
included a clean left main coronary artery , a LAD with luminal
irregularities , small vessel in general , and a T1 with about 60%
stenosis , also small vessel , and circumflex with about 70% mid
stenosis. The RCA , where her past stents had been placed , was
completely occluded , which was ballooned and a brief examination of
the abdominal aorta for renal artery stenosis revealed no evidence
of renal artery stenosis. Thus , no stents were placed , but the
patient's old stents were ballooned open with good achieved flow
and 40% residual after ballooning. The patient continued to do
well the day post-cath and ultimately was sent home the following
morning with follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iorio Jaclyn-Cassandra</PHI>
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ECASA 325 mg p.o. q.d.; captopril 37.5 mg

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: The patient was brought to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> ED by her daughter with the chief
complaint of left leg pain. They were concerned about the healing of her
left fibula/tibia fracture.
---
HPI: The patient is a 72-year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG , chronic kidney
disease ( declined HD ) , congestive heart failure ( EF 30% ) , HTN , and
hypocalcemia. She has also been hospitalized numerous times in the past
two years for CHF exacerbations in the setting of NSTEMI. She has
preferred not to take any of her prescribed medications despite repeated
discussions about benefits of decreased mortality , prevention of
re-hospitalization , and symptom management. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> 2006 she sustained a
displaced LLE tib/fib fx after banging her leg into her bed while driving
her motorized scooter in her apartment. She has been treated by Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ivana Cesar</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> . She initally refused surgical repair and was
casted , but subsequent films have shown valgus angulation and poor
healing. She declined surgery ( and was a high-risk surgical candidate
given her multiple comorbidities. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/18/21</PHI> the cast was removed by
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">KGWCWN</PHI> and has been in a walking boot since then. She states that
she has pain of the left midleg that she has treated with Tylenol and
that has limited her ability to try and bear weight.
Her daughter brings her in today because of concern for her mother's left
leg. The air cast was taken off yesterday and since then , she has had
worsening pain of the leg. She has been unable to move it or bear any
wait. There is a valgus deformity. They are requesting orthopedic
evaluation. She denies new numbness/tingling or weakness in the
extremities. She also notes multiple chronic problems including
decreased appetite with 40lb weight loss over the past 4-6 months ,
lethargy , apathy. "I just want to be able to walk again and do the
things I used to like doing." ( Going to the horse track , walking
outside. ) She states that she is NOT depressed but sleeps most of the
day.
The family has discussed these symptoms with her PCP. In the past ,
symptoms have been attributed to her worsening renal failure , cardiac
status in this patient who refuses to take any medications. She has
wanted to remain home yet has had documented discussions with PCP about
the benefits of placement to a nursing home for longterm care. Family is
currently looking into assisted living facilities. She also has
requested DNR/DNI status in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease: s/p IMI and 2-V-CABG , <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 2001

severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
7. History of colon cancer status post a partial colectomy. The patient
has requested no follow-up for this problem.
8. Osteoarthritis status post a left total hip replacement for aseptic
necrosis. Since that time she has a leg length discrepancy and uses
crutches to ambulate until a recent tib/fib fx which has left her
WC-dependent.

_________________________________________
IMPRESSION:
72F with multiple chronic medical problems s/p recent tib/fib fx
( non-surg mgmt ) admitted for evaluation of her fracture. She was admitted
to medicine for "longterm placement." Yet upon interview of the family
they intend for Ms. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">HUWGL</PHI> to go home after this hospital stay. From
there , she will transition to assisted living. Over the last few months ,
she has declined to take any medications or treatment for her chronic
kidney disease or cardiac disease. This has led to progressive renal
disease , electrolyte abnormalities and myopathy. The family brings her
in with concerns regarding her left leg. While they do want to
transition to assisted living , they do not intend to place her directly
from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vidrine</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">NDP</PHI> or Rehab. They hope she will go home after this hospital
stay and continue with VNA/services.
ORTHO: Tib/fib fracture. Non-surgically managed. Followed by Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ingraham , Yevette Wilkinson</PHI> Seen by Orthopedic service who discussed the 2 options:
casting with patellar tendon bearing cast or surgery. As before ,
patient declined surgery ( this decision has been supported by her PCP and
cardiologist as she is a high risk surgical candidate. ) There were no
casting technicians in-house this weekend. Therefore she will followup in
the Orthopedics clinic on Wednesday , as instructed by the ortho resident
on call.
.

Discharge Date: <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/20/2906</PHI>
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , QUESTION ASTHMA.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
IDENTIFICATION DATA: This patient is a 59-year-old white female
with known coronary artery disease , past
history of myocardial infarction admitted <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/15/06</PHI> with three weeks
of worsening dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient's coronary risk factors
include hypertension , elevated
cholesterol , 25-pack-year smoking history and a positive family
history. In 1983 , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Padilla Clinic</PHI>
where she ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction with peak
CK of 182 , 7% MB. EKG showed global T wave inversions. The
patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI> where a
cardiac catheterization was performed which showed an 80% proximal
LAD lesion and a 30% mid RCA lesion. The patient was then
transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Valene Melba Conley;</PHI> for PTCA. The angioplasty
procedure was not done. The patient was managed medically and did
well for the next seven years from a cardiac standpoint. She had
only minimal anginal symptoms and shortness of breath during that
period. In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of 1988 , the patient had an echocardiogram
which showed significant LVH , decreased LV compliance , borderline
left atrial enlargement and no regional wall motion abnormalities.
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1991 , the patient had an ETT in which she exercised for
four minutes , 28 seconds achieving a peak heart rate of 103 and a
peak blood pressure of 150/60 , stopping secondary to fatigue and
shortness of breath without chest pain or EKG changes. Also in
<PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1991 , the patient had pulmonary function tests which
showed normal spirometry and lung volumes. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27/06</PHI> , the patient
was having progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion
that morning. She presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cervantes Lazaro</PHI> with worsening
dyspnea , wheezing. Her respiratory rate was 30 , and O2 saturation
was 85%. The patient was treated for presumed asthma with
Bronkosol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol. During the second Bronkosol
treatment , the patient developed 2/10 substernal chest pressure
radiating to the left arm which was relieved completely with one
sublingual nitroglycerin. There were no EKG changes. The patient
was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI> where she underwent
a V-Q scan , the results of which showed low probability of
pulmonary embolus. O2 saturation was 95%. The patient was sent
home on Ventolin inhaler. The patient stayed at home for the next
three weeks , symptom-free. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/15</PHI> , the patient while walking at
the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</PHI> became acutely short of breath with 2/10
substernal chest pressure radiating to the right arm without
nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis or lightheadedness. The chest
pressure and shortness of breath decreased with rest. The patient
then presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lakeisha Cummings</PHI> and was then transferred to
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vania Cyril Vergara Alvin Charity:</PHI> . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary
artery disease , status post myocardial infarction as above.
Hypertension. Type II hyperlipidemia. Sjorgren's syndrome.
History of deep venous thromboses in 1981. Status post IVC
umbrella placement in 1981. Fibrocystic breast disease.
MEDICATIONS: On admission included diltiazem SR , 90 mg b.i.d.;
Ventolin inhaler; aspirin. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of heart attack at age 78. SOCIAL
HISTORY: The patient works as a Bookkeeper at a law firm. She is
divorced with three grown children. She is a 40-pack-year smoker
and stopped one year ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an obese white
female in no apparent distress. Vital signs
revealed a heart rate of 92 , blood pressure 120/70 , respirations
20 , afebrile. Skin and HEENT exams were normal. Chest revealed no
CVA tenderness. Lungs revealed trace inspiratory crackles at both
bases. There were no wheezes heard. Cardiac exam revealed PMI
nonpalpable , regular rate and rhythm. There was a I/VI midsystolic
murmur heard at the left sternal border , no gallops. JVP was not
appreciated. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally without bruits. Abdomen
was obese , well healed old surgical scars , soft , nontender , no
hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed trace pedal edema and
symmetrical pedal pulses. Neurological exam was nonfocal. Rectal
exam was normal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a sodium of 137 , potassium
4.5. Chloride was 103. CO2 19. BUN 18.
Creatinine 1.2. Glucose 205 which normalized to 93 the next day.
Hematocrit was 36. White blood cell count was 14.2. Platelet
count 328 , 000. Urinalysis showed trace red blood cells and some
bacteria. EKG while pain free , showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 ,
axis of 40 degrees , intervals 0.21/0.10/0.36 and flat T waves in I
and L. Chest x-ray showed a question infiltrate in the left base
consistent with atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vallejo , Voigt Mollie Izzo Woodrow</PHI> Emergency
Room where she was tachypneic and wheezing with a
pO2 of 86%. EKG showed only T wave flattening in I and L. The
patient was admitted for presumed asthma and bronchitis and treated
with Bronkosol nebulizers. In the setting of the Bronkosol , the
patient had substernal chest pressure radiating to the left arm.
EKG showed 1 mm of ST depression in I and L and 1 mm ST elevation
in lead III. The pain resolved with three sublingual
nitroglycerin. The pain recurred a few minutes later and was again
resolved with Nitropaste and IV Lopressor. The patient ruled out
for myocardial infarction with CPK's of 43 , 36 , 37. The patient
was then transferred to the Medical Service and was managed with
diltiazem , Lopressor , Isordil and aspirin. On hospital day number
two , the patient went for echocardiogram which was not obtained
because the patient had developed 5/10 substernal chest pressure
which resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. There were no
EKG changes , the patient was started on heparin with question of
unstable angina at that time. On hospital day number three , the
patient went for cardiac catheterization which showed serial 40 and
50% lesions in the LAD and also an 80% lesion in the distal RCA.
There were no complications post catheterization. It was
questionable whether these lesions were serious enough to account
for the patient's symptoms. The patient's medical regimen was
advanced and she has tolerated that well and has been symptom free
for the past 48 hours. She was discharged home in stable
condition. She will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Salas Usha--Nannette.</PHI> in one week. The
patient also had asymptomatic pyuria and bacteruria and was treated
for a presumed urinary tract infection with three days of oral
Bactrim.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included diltiazem SR ,
120 mg po b.i.d.; Lopressor , 100 mg b.i.d.; Isordil ,
20 mg t.i.d.; aspirin , one q day.

month. She denies orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Afebrile , heart rate 92 , blood
pressure 126/73 , oxygen saturation 98% on
two liters , 94% on room air. General: She is an obese , elderly
black female in no apparent distress. HEENT examination was
unremarkable. Chest showed bibasilar crackles. Cardiovascular
examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with a soft systolic
murmur at the left lower sternal border. Jugular venous pressure
was elevated at 10 cm. Her abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender.
Extremities showed 2+ edema , pitting to the knees.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission revealed a BUN of 19
and a creatinine of 1.4. CBC was normal. EKG was
normal sinus rhythm at 97 with first degree atrioventricular block
and left ventricular hypertrophy and no change compared with <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI>
of 1997. Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with congestive heart
failure , diuresed with increasing doses of Lasix ,
Prinivil was increased to 30 mg a day. An echocardiogram was
obtained which showed normal left ventricular function and left
ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60% and 3+
mitral regurgitation. With this result , Lopressor was added 25 mg
p.o. b.i.d. for presumptive diastolic dysfunction. Her Lasix dose

ASSESSMENT: This is a 71-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension , CHF , status post a mitral valve/tricuspid valve
repair in mid <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> , complicated by postoperative C. diff
colitis and UTI who presented with persistent diarrhea and three
days of fever , chills and chest pain. The patient's fatigue was
most likely related to dehydration secondary to persistent C.
diff related diarrhea. Over the course of her hospitalization ,
it became clear that she experienced chest pain during her
intermittent episodes of ventricular ectopy. Now that her NSVT
is under better control , she is chest pain-free.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker ,
statin and gemfibrozil. She had negative cardiac enzymes x3 and
ruled out by biomarkers.
Pump: The patient was initially dry on exam. She was rehydrated
with normal saline. The patient developed shortness of breath on
hospital day #4 , most likely secondary to overhydration. She was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Electrolytes were repleted twice
daily. She was then transitioned to 40 of Lasix p.o. daily and
finally per cardiology recommendation 20. She will be discharged
to home on 20 b.i.d. p.o.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. On
hospital day #2 , she developed atrial fibrillation with
hypotension most likely secondary to Diltiazem , which was
subsequently held. The patient's blood pressure improved
dramatically with gentle IV hydration on hospital day #2. Her
Diltiazem will be discontinued. The patient is on Coumadin now
with therapeutic INR on discharge at 2.6. Per cardiology , her
beta-blocker was increased to 75 q.i.d. and then she was
transitioned to Toprol 300 daily; however , she had persistent
nocturnal NSVT , which caused her some chest pain and was quite
frightening to her. Per cardiology , she was loaded on amiodarone
400 t.i.d. , which will be continued for 5 days post-discharge and
then the patient will be transitioned to 400 amiodarone daily.
At the same time , her Toprol will be decreased to 100 mg daily ,
her discharge dose. Echocardiogram was ordered on the day of
discharge per cardiology. See LMR for formal report.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient with recent UTI and C. diff
colitis in the setting of recent hospitalization antibiotic use
presented with diarrhea and elevated white count and fever.
Continued on Flagyl p.o. and vancomycin p.o. for Flagyl failure.
She had one C. diff positive stool. Stool became C. diff
negative as of <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/20/21.</PHI> Her diarrhea rapidly slowed on dual
therapy. She will be discharged with seven more days of
antibiotics to complete.
3. Endocrine: The patient on home dose Synthroid. TSH
initially low , however , rechecked and found to be within normal
limits. Continue home dose of Synthroid.
4. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout her
hospitalization. Continue Niferex at home dose , continue
Coumadin at 2.5 mg nightly.
5. Pulmonary: The patient had a low pretest probability for PE.
Given her allergy to IV contrast , she was not a candidate for
PECT; however , a V/Q scan was obtained on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/19/21.</PHI> The result
was low probability for pulmonary embolism. Her respiratory exam
improved greatly on b.i.d. Lasix.
6. Renal. The patient's creatinine was stable throughout her
hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: Coumadin with therapeutic INR plus proton pump
inhibitor.
8. FEN: The patient was initially started on a clear liquid
diet. On hospital day #3 , she began to eat solid foods and
tolerated well.
9. Code status: The patient was a full code throughout her
hospitalization.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Continue home medications as indicated.
2. Continue vancomycin and Flagyl for 7 more days.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS FOR ADMISSION:
Asthma exacerbation.
LIST OF PROBLEMS DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
1. Asthma exacerbation.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Iron deficiency anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 38-year-old female with a history of asthma , type II
diabetes mellitus , obesity , depression , and iron deficiency
anemia who presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vera Mcintyre Tuan Vita Andy Clinic</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/25/21</PHI>
complaining of worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness
over the past three days after running out of her asthma
medications approximately two weeks ago. The patient had ran out
of her Advair , albuterol , and Singulair as well as her Lasix.
She denied any fevers or chills , no nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
chest pain , or cough. She did report some increased lower
extremity edema over the past several days and admits to not
taking her Lasix. She went to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">VMIW</PHI> urgernt care on the day of admission and was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 84% on room air and she was
sent to the Emergency Room for admission. In the ED , she
received nebulizer treatments and prednisone 60 mg x1 and her O2
saturation improved to 95% on 2 liters.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
The patient takes Advair 500/50 b.i.d. , albuterol nebulizers
q.4h. p.r.n. , iron 325 mg t.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg daily , Lasix
40 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , metformin 850 mg
b.i.d. , Prozac 40 mg daily , Singulair 10 mg daily , and a
multivitamin daily.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Pertinent for shortness of breath and chest tightness.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Exam on admission , patient was afebrile. Her pulse was 100 ,
blood pressure 116/70 , respiratory rate 22 , and O2 saturation of
95% on 2 liters. The patient was awake , alert and oriented x3
and in no apparent distress. Her lungs had scattered wheezing
bilaterally with good air movement. Heart with normal S1 , S2 and
tachycardic. Abdomen is obese , soft , nondistended , nontender.
Extremities had 1+ bilateral pitting edema and mild erythema of
her bilateral shins.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
White blood cell count was 10.6 and hematocrit 30. Chest x-ray
showed a large cardiac silhouette with no evidence of effusion or
infiltrate. The patient had a PE protocol CT which was a
suboptimal study due to poor body habitus but it was negative for
PE , it did show bilateral ground glass opacities and evidence of
air trapping. It also showed moderate hepatomegaly.
PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
The patient had a PECT and she also had pulmonary function tests
performed.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 38-year-old female with asthma , diabetes , anemia , and
morbid obesity who was admitted with his asthma exacerbation in
the setting of running out of her medications at home.
1. Pulmonary: The patient was started on prednisone 60 mg p.o.
daily and remained on it for approximately seven days. It was
difficult to taper her prednisone due to oxygen desaturations
with ambulation. The patient's oxygen desaturated to 74-84% with
ambulation. The patient , however , was tapered and is currently
on 50 mg daily , of prednisone and will be sent out on a seven-day
taper. She was also continued on her Advair and Singulair. As
mentioned above , she had a PE protocol CT that showed no PE.
However , it was a suboptimal study due to patient's body habitus.
It did show ground glass opacities. Because the patient had
desaturations with ambulation , it was concerned that the patient
possibly had an atypical pneumonia given these ground glass
opacities. She was started on levofloxacin and should complete a
five-day course. The patient was also tested for HIV which was
negative. She had a BNP to rule out any evidence of volume
overload that was contributing to her oxygen desaturations. BNP
was 5. The patient also had hepatitis serologies due to
hepatomegaly seen on PECT and these were negative as well.
Influenza swabs were negative. The patient was seen in consult
by the pulmonary team and they felt that the patient requireed
home oxygen especially at night and with ambulation. The
patient's O2 saturation while sleeping was 84%. It is highly
suspected that the patient has a component of sleep apnea and she
is to be set up for an outpatient sleep study. Pulmonary also
recommended obtaining a pulmonary function test. These were done
and it showed an FVC of 51% and an FEV1 of 49% and an FEV-FVC
ratio of 97% as well as a total lung capacity of 53% and a DLCO
of 82%. Pulmonary function tests were consistent with
restrictive disease and this is likely due to patient's obesity.
The patient most likely has obesity hypoventilation. We spoke
with her in depth about the importance of losing weight to help
improve her respiratory status as well as her overall health.
The patient is scheduled to have an outpatient sleep study and
she is also to follow up with her outpatient pulmonologist , Dr.
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Underhill.</PHI> Home oxygen was set up for the patient as well.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on her lisinopril
and her Lasix was resumed for her lower extremity edema. This
did improve throughout her hospitalization. A lipid panel was
checked and this was in the normal range. The patient should be
started on aspirin given her diabetes and her hypertension.
However , she has been experienced menorrhagia and is anemic so
the aspirin should be started as an outpatient after her
menorrhagia is addressed.
3. Hematology: The patient was found to be iron deficient by
labs and she was continued on iron supplements three times a day.
The patient also complains of heavy menstruation and she has a
history of uterine fibroids , she was supposed to follow up with
GYN as an outpatient but missed her appointment. She was
instructed to follow up with GYN.
4. Endocrine: The patient's home medications of glyburide and
metformin were held and she was placed on NPH 25 units b.i.d.
with a NovoLog sliding scale and 12 units q.a.c. Her hemoglobin
A1c was 7. She was resumed on her home regimen at discharge.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient received Lovenox and Nexium for
prophylaxis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
The patient was awake , alert , oriented x3. She is 95% on room
air at rest but did continue to desaturate into the 80s with
ambulation. She is awake , alert , oriented x3. Her lungs were
clear bilaterally. There were no other pertinent findings on
exam at discharge.
CONSULTANTS DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
Pulmonary was Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Christine.</PHI>
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was sent home on albuterol inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ,
ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Prozac 40 mg p.o. daily ,
Advair Diskus 500/50 one puff b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,
glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Levaquin 750 mg p.o. daily , x1 more
dose , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , metformin 850 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily , and a
prednisone taper 40 mg daily x2 days , then 30 mg daily x2 days ,
then 20 mg daily x2 days , then 10 mg daily x2 days , then stopping
it and multivitamin one tablet daily.
INSTRUCTIONS ON DISCHARGE:
The patient was encouraged to follow up with GYN as an outpatient
regarding her uterine fibroids and menorrhagia. A follow-up
appointment was scheduled with both her primary care physician
and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Underhill.</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January.</PHI> She met with Nutrition during the
hospitalization and had a long conversation with the medical team
regarding weight loss strategies.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES:
The patient is a full code.
