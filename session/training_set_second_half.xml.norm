ADMISSION DATE :
06/18/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
06/23/97
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 35-year-old female had a history of bilateral severe hearing loss since the age of four , which worsened several years ago .
This was evaluated by Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint beginning in the early 1990s. The diagnosis of atypical Meniere &apos;s disease was made .
A CT scan without contrast in 1991 was reported to be normal .
She reported there was still some sound perception in the left ear , although it was not useful hearing .
In the right ear , she used a hearing aid , which helped her .
On 5/16/97 , she awakened with tingling and numbness involving first her left arm , then the leg , then the face , associated with mild headache and nausea .
The numbness persisted .
No focal objective neurological deficit was found .
Magnetic resonance imaging showed findings consistent with an acoustic neuroma in the left cerebellar pontine angle extending approximately 3 centimeters into the posterior fossa .
There was a cystic component on the medial superior aspect of the tumor .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
There was severe loss of hearing in both ears .
No other focal neurological deficit was found .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On 6/18/97 , a left suboccipital craniotomy was done , and in conjunction with Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint and Dr. Zette Breunelksbelb , total removal of an acoustic neuroma was accomplished .
The facial nerve was markedly involved with the tumor .
Only a portion of the fibers could be kept intact , and the rest were reapproximated .
Postoperatively , she had complete facial paralysis .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yertrey Sumchirdkaysmavveindreps of the Ocular Plastic Service , and on 6/19/97 , a gold weight was placed in the left upper eyelid .
Her overall course was one of rapid improvement .
There was minimal incoordination of the left upper extremity .
She ambulated initially with help , but this was rapidly improving .
There was no evidence of cerebral spinal fluid leak .
The incision was healing well at the time of discharge .
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
1 ) Left acoustic neuroma .
2 ) Left facial paralysis .
3 ) Atypical Meniere &apos;s disease .

Per her daughter , who lives with her , 6 am she was awake in bed not complaining of weakness .
However , at that time she did not get out of bed .
At 8:30 am she awoke out of bed and noticed that her arm and leg felt &quot; heavy &quot; and she was unable to walk without dragging her R leg .
Denied numbness or tingling , no change in mental status .
She was brought to ED for further evaluation .
ROS :
negative for recent headache , neck or head trauma , illness or fevers .
Negative for dysarthria , facial weakness or sensory loss , dyspnea or dysphagia , focal sensory loss , dizziness , confusion , loss of consciousness , seizures , falls .
PMH :

PE ON ADMISSION :
BP 216/92 , HR 78 , afebrile ; General exam was notable for chronic skin changes on LE .
NEURO EXAM :
Mental status was intact .
Cranial nerves notable for slight R facial weakness , otherwise intact .
Motor exam - full strength on left ; Right sided arm and leg weakness 3-4/5 , greater distally than proximally .
Sensation intact .
The right toe was upgoing , the left down .
She was able to stand only with support .
Labs on admission :
Glu 107 , BUN 10 , Cr 0.8 , Na 140 , K 3.5 , LFTs WNL , troponin less than assay ; WBC 5.6 , HCT 41.8 , PLT 240 , coags
WNL IMAGING :
Head
CT :
no evidence infarction
Head / Neck CTA :
No evidence of abnormality except for a congenitally small vertebrobasilar system
MRI Brain :
Infarction within the left lenticular nucleus extending superiorly to the left corona radiata ; small vessel disease
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Pt was admitted to the neurology service for work-up .
As she had been taking ASA prior to admission , Aggrenox was started for secondary prevention .
Homocystine was high at 12 , therefore vitamins B6 , B12 and folate were started ; Cholesterol was high at 259 with an LDL of 192 - a statin was initiated .
Blood pressures were initially allowed to run in the 150s-160s , however at the time of discharge more aggressive BP management is advised , and in addition to her beta-blocker , an ACE-inhibitor was started .
A TTE preliminary read shows an EF of 60% with mild AI , trace MR , trace TR , LVH ; a bubble study was negative .
A 24-hour Holter is pending ; the Pt was in NSR on EKGs , and was ruled-out for MI by cardiac enzymes .
Pt was seen by PT and OT who have recommended acute rehabilitation .
Clinically , the Pt improved during the hospital course , with residual mild R nasolabial fold flattening , 4+/5 strength proximally of the right arm and leg ; she is slightly weaker distally with 3/5 of the interosseous muscles on the right .
IMPRESSION :
This is a 67 y / o woman with poorly controlled HTN , hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism , who presented with a lacunar stroke , most likely due to HTN .
Given her fairly young age , investigation of cardioembolic sources was pursued and not found by TTE , though a Holter report is still pending .
Secondary prevention will include improved BP treatment ( added ACE ) , cholesterol treatment ( added statin ) , treatment of high homocystine with B vitamins , and a switch from ASA to Aggrenox .
She is being discharged to rehab and will F / U in the neurology clinic in 4-6 weeks .

The pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate .
Sputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for AFB smear cultures .
His electrocardiogram was within normal limits .
His urine sediment was basically within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia .
The differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .
(1) Pneumonia .
He was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .
The pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .
He was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , Clindamycin , and Ciprofloxacin .
The ration off for the utilization of the Ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to Erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for Legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .
However , he was isolated , and three AFB smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .
In addition , sputum induction was performed for Pneumocystis , which was negative .
His urinary Legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .
However , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for Legionella pneumophila , type I , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease .
However , the Legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other Legionella species that may be involved in Legionella pneumonia .
Therefore , the Ciprofloxacin was continued .
In addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .
After admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , Mr. Cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic .
However , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .
Because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .
Therefore , an evaluation by the Pulmonary Team of the Tonwe Hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest CT scan , were all obtained .
The chest CT scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .
His sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .
The Pulmonary Team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .
Despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , Mr. Cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .
It should be noted , that Clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .
Additionally , when switched to oral medication , Mr. Cliffestreukote was switched to Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his Ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d.
(2) Hypertension .
While in the hospital , Mr. Cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and Verapamil SR , and required no additional medication .
(3) Hyponatremia .
While in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient &apos;s Profile 7 labs .
It was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .
While in the hospital , there were no complications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , Verapamil SR 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and Atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day .
DISPOSITION :
His condition on discharge was stable .
He was discharged to home .
He has a followup appointment with Dr. Naaan Jesc , in the Tonwe Hospital Pulmonary Clinic on 2-18-95 , at 9:45 A.M. , as well as with his primary care physician , Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint .
His estimated disability is mild .
We are still awaiting the results of his HIV testing .

ATTENDING :
CRILI THONTA TLANDBINDE MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Miller-Fisher variant Guillain Barre syndrome .
Sixth nerve palsy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 45-year-old male who complained of a 2-day history of horizontal diplopia that began in rightward gaze and was now present bilaterally .
Of note , the patient reports a 2-week history of upper respiratory infection and sinus congestion .
He reports that the day before admission , he awoke with diplopia that did resolve with monocular vision .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient had pupils that were equal , round , and reactive to light bilaterally .
Accommodation was intact .
Visual fields were full by confrontation .
Of note , there was right than greater than left abducens weakness noted by the physical examiner on admission .
His strength in his extremities was normal and he had normal reflexes .
MRI of the brain demonstrated significant right sphenoid maxillary and ethmoid sinus inflammation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Procedures :
The patient was evaluated initially by the Otolaryngology Service with the consideration that his right-sided sinus disease was contributing to his sixth nerve palsy .
He was started on antibiotic treatment for his sinus findings .
However , further review by Neurology Consult Service indicated that the sinus disease was likely not sufficient to explain the patient &apos;s cranial nerve findings .
The working diagnosis at that point was the Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome versus less likely causes .
The patient underwent lumbar puncture and also had an electromyelogram performed .
EMG findings were in fact consistent with variant Guillain-Barre syndrome .
It was then determined that the patient should be started on intravenous immunoglobulin .
He was therefore started with a treatment course of 6 days of IV IgA after obtaining an IgA level .
The patient tolerated this treatment course well .
His cranial neuropathy was monitored carefully and was found to be stable to slightly improving in the first several days of treatment .
He was also treated with IV steroids .
By 08/20/2003 , the patient has tolerated the full treatment course and had a substantial improvement in his diplopia .
It was then determined that the patient was safe to discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n. pain .
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOW UP :
The plan for follow up was with Dr. Viennee Breutzfreierm within 14 days of discharge .

The EUS showed a normal common bile duct , normal pancreas and a 4-cm gastric wall solid mass , which was hypoechoic , heterogenetic and lobulated in appearance .
She had biopsies taken , which are pending at this time .
Of note , there was an extensive differential diagnosis for her unilateral effusion including malignancy , tuberculosis , drug-induced lupus and less likely pestis related .
The exudative nature of the effusion argues against congestive heart failure or hepatic hydrothorax .
Ms. Walking was stable at the time of discharge .
She was discharged home .

Report Status :

Discharge Date :

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
LEFT ROTATOR CUFF TEAR .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Back pain .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Ankle surgery times two on the right .
Pilonidal cyst removal .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included Naprosyn .
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
HABITS :
The patient smokes two packs per day and has an approximately a 75-pack-year history of smoking .
He has a history of drinking which he discontinued in May .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a white male with no palpable adenopathy .
HEENT exam was within normal limits .
Lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
Heart was regular with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
Pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
Abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
Examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to 170 degrees , internally rotate to 10 degrees and externally rotate to 40 degrees with positive joint tenderness .
All range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
The left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG &apos;s were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary .

MEDICATIONS :

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mayta Neek is a 69-year-old patient of Dr. Queszucenove Tadl at Cochusetts Medical Center .
He presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .
He has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .
His first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by Dr. Riez .
He had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .
He presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .
He had normal left ventricular function .
He did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in March of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .
The left main was normal .
The LAD was also occluded .
The circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .
The LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .
The snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .
For this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by Dr. Riez .
He had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .
He had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .
The LIMA was left from the first surgery .
He did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .
He had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .
He did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .
He therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .
He also has had cataract repairs .
FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His social history is that he lives in Lotyvall 1 , Quera , Minnesota with his wife Second .
He has four children .
He is present in a Capefrecam Luhthousy .
He does not drink and does not smoke .
ALLERGIES :
He is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .
His blood pressure is 130/75 .
His pulse is 50 and regular .
His neck veins are not distended .
His head and neck exam is normal .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .
His abdomen is benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
His neurologic exam was nonfocal .
He is fully oriented .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .
Hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .
There , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .
The LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .
The vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .
The culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .
This was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .
It was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .
Left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .
He tolerated the procedure well .
He was monitored for the day .
He ambulated without difficulty .
He was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health and at Middso Memorial Hospital &apos;s .
He will remain on beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , statins , aspirin and Plavix indefinitely .

Chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation .
EKG showed sinus brady at 16 , normal axis , normal intervals , no STT wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI .
Hospital course by system :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .
This responded to fluid bolus .
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .
Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. Infectious Disease :
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .
On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
She was started on vancomycin for this .
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. GI :
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. Shortness of breath :
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .
5. Derm :
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .
Albuterol inhaler .
Lipitor , 20 daily .
Prozac , 60 daily .
Flovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid .
Atrovent , two puffs qid .

DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE :
1. STATUS POST MOTORVEHICLE ACCIDENT WITH TRANSIENT PARAPLEGIA .
2. RIGHT HYDRONEPHROSIS ON CT SCAN .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 20 year old black female who was a pedestrian when struck by a car at apparent high speed .
There was apparent loss of consciousness at the scene and significant deformity of the anterior portion of the motorvehicle with positive starring of the windshield .
The patient was conscious on the scene when evaluated by EMT &apos;s but at the scene , the patient was apparently paraplegic below the umbilicus with absence of movement and sensation below the umbilicus .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
None .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Status post laparotomy for an ovarian cyst in 1988 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
She denies cigarette use and ethanol use as well as a recreational drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On initial exam , her left shoulder was tender to palpation over the proximal humerus with decreased range of motion .
She was without the ability to move her left lower extremity with decreased sensation in the left leg .
The right leg was with decreased range of motion of thigh flexion and extension .
The back was notable for tenderness at the level of L3-L5 .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Initial radiologic evaluation showed negative C-spine , thoracic spine , and lumbosacral spine films .
Abdominal CT was negative except for right hydronephrosis with mild right hydroureter .
Back MRI was negative .
Film of the left humerus was also negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained , and it was their impression that the patient &apos;s paraplegia might possibly represent a cord concussion , and recommended treatment with intravenous steroids for 24 hours .
The patient &apos;s paraplegia resolved by the morning of her second hospital day , and she maintained 5/5 motor strength in all groups .
A Urology consultation was obtained , and it was recommended that an IVP be obtained .
This was obtained on the day of discharge , however , due to residual contrast in the colon from the patient &apos;s prior abdominal CT scan , the exam was postponed after a scout film was obtained .
The patient fell well on the day of discharge .
She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course .
Additionally on the night before discharge , flexion and extension views of the lumbosacral spine were obtained , and showed no fracture or instability .
DISPOSITION :
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4 hours p.r.n. pain .
She will followup in the Wardca Presiew Hospital in one week .

Gait disorder .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who &quot; had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .
Her Doxepin has recently been increased .
She is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .
ALLERGIES :
Quinine gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .
She was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .
There is a history of childhood abuse .
She does not drink .
She is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was pleasant , in no acute distress ; blood pressure 130/60 ; heart rate 66 ; respirations 18 ; temperature 98 .
Her thyroid was within normal limits .
There were no carotid or cervical bruits .
She had a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Her abdomen was benign .
Her extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .
Mental status - her speech was fluent without errors .
Her affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .
Her memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .
Visual fields were full to confrontation .
Her left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .
Her right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .
Her extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .
There was no nystagmus and no ptosis .
Her saccades were normal .
Facial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .
Her tongue , uvula and palate were midline .
Shoulder shrug was 5/5 power .
Motor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .
There was no drift .
There was normal bulk and tone .
She had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .
Sensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .
Reflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .
There was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .
Coordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .
On standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .
Her heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .
LABORATORY DATA :
Were unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .
Her coagulation parameters were normal .
Head CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
The patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
This trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
She will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .
She will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .

He was also short of breath with ambulation , but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion .
He denied any chest pain , dysuria , loss of consciousness , fevers , chills or any history of myocardial infarction .

He was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin C and iron sulfate .
EXAM ON ARRIVAL IN THE LO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM :
On arrival at the Lo Hospital Emergency Room :
He was found to have a temperature of 97.4 , heart rate 65 , pressure 107/52 , respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100% on 2 L of a nasal cannula .
General exam at the time was notable for pale mucous membranes , left lateral eye deviation , clear lungs , 2/6 holosystolic murmur , best heard at the apex , abdomen was mildly distended but was soft and nontender and his extremities were without edema and skin without any rashes .

The patient also , following his first GI bleed , had an EEG done in 07/2003 which showed gastritis with oozing and evidence of a recent bleed .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .

OTHER NOTALBE LABS :
Patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a CK of 46 and CKMB of 3.4 .
ASSESSMENT :
At that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat GI bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient &apos;s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .

Chest x-ray negative .
Head computerized tomography scan on 10/19 : 3 centimeter hyperdensity within the right putamenal area in the right external capsusle consistent with intra-parenchymal hematoma with mild local mass effect and surrounding edema .
No other areas of hemorrhage identified .
Head computerized tomography scan of 10/23 :
the area of hemorrhage the same , slightly more edema and mass effect .
Pulmonary angiogram :
no evidence of pulmonary emboli .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua &apos;s cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .
A magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage .
At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient &apos;s young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. po q.day , Captopril 75 mg. po three times a day , Nifedipine 40 mg. po three times a day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will followup with Dr. ______________at Omend Hospital and with Dr. Deep at the Barb Memorial Hospital .
DISABILITY :
100% for now .
Will be reassessed after a month of intensive physical therapy and occupational therapy .

Discharge Date :
01/13/2003
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled diabetes , status post multiple admissions for HHNK , and recent right arm fracture .
Patient initially presented four days ago to the emergency room .
At that time , she was febrile , with no obvious source of infection .
She was sent home with pain control .
Cultures were pending .
Over the past days before admission , the patient had been complaining of increased arm pain .
Of note , the patient states that her pain is so bad that she was not taking her insulin .
On the morning of admission , the son could not reach her by phone .
He was concerned .
LRAH then called to say that they found her in the house very confused , called EMS , and she was brought into the hospital .
Per the son , patient not complaining of any other problems ; no chest pain , no shortness of breath , no upper respiratory symptoms , no cough , no dysuria , and no abdominal pain .
Of note , blood cultures from Christmas Eve grew MSSA in the blood .
In the emergency room , she was given 6 units subcu , with no resolve , then insulin drip at 6 units per hour , then increased to 10 including with IV hydration , and she was started on nafcillin for MSSA .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cirrhosis , hep C , diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , hypertension , neuropathy , right arm fracture , status post fall , CAD , with a stress echo 12/1 which showed reversible ischemia and an EF of 60% .
Her medications on admission included Lasix 80 , Norvasc 2.5 , Lopressor 50 b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 q. day , Risperdal one q. day , Humulin 70/30 40 U in the morning and 25 U in the evening , regular insulin scale , carbamazepine 100 , and Neurontin .
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
She walks with a cane , has LRAH care , no tobacco , no alcohol , no drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION :
She was afebrile at 97.6 , heart rate 102 , respirations 20 , blood pressure 192/92 .
In general , she was an obese African American woman in no acute distress , mumbling .
HEENT :
Pupils equal and reactive , her oropharynx was moist with no lesions .
Cardiovascularly , she was tachycardic , normal S1 and S2 , regular , no murmurs .
JVP was flat .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender , no masses , no rebound , and no guarding .
EXTREMITIES :
She had swelling in the right arm , very , very minimal .
Her right arm was on a sling .
In her lower extremities , she had bilateral edema to the knees , 2+.
NEURO :
She was oriented to person only , intermittently following commands .
Labs were notable for blood cultures positive for MSSA .
Chest x-ray was pending at the time of admission .
Head CT was negative .
EKG showed normal sinus , no ST changes .
Her labs were notable on admission for a sodium of 129 , creatinine of 2.0 , hematocrit of 34 , albumin was 2.5 .
She had a gap of 14 .
Her ABG was 7.40 , 47 , 90 .
Her CKs and troponins were negative .
Her beta hydroxybutyrate was 0.36 .
Her UA showed 3+ protein , 5-8 WBCs , 8-10 RBCs , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
This is a 55-year-old with a history of uncontrolled diabetes in the past , who presents with HHNK .
At the time , she was treated for such , including IV fluids and an insulin drip .
She recovered very nicely .
Continued hospital course , she recovered well from her HHNK .
Ortho-wise , emergent ortho consult decided that the right shoulder needed to be drained .
Tap showed that she had an active infection , with 464000 WBCs , 198000 RBCs , including 88% polys , from the right shoulder .
Therefore , she was thought to have right shoulder sepsis and was taken to the OR emergently .
In the operating room , 40-50 cc of pus was drained from the shoulder and a drain was placed .
She received IV fluids and had an estimated blood loss of 1200 cc .
The patient &apos;s crit dropped from a baseline of 32 to 19 .
She was also not following commands and her glucose was 876 .
She was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit on 12/30/02 , the patient was recovering , with being able to follow commands .
She stayed in the Intensive Care Unit until 1/5/03 .
She was treated with nafcillin and gentamicin , also with vancomycin .
Cultures still showed MSSA .
Hospital course during the MICU stay was notable for a decreased hematocrit .
She received multiple units of blood for this .
Also , she had decreased urine output , thought to be prerenal , and received large volume IV fluids .
She required small doses , a renal dose of dopa , to increase her urine output , and she did better .
She responded well and then the dopa was D / c&apos;d on 1/4/03 .
From the ID perspective , the patient had a TTE on 12/30 that showed an EF of 65% , question of a mobile echodensity along the RV , but no proof of endocarditis .
This was significant in that the head CT done on 1/4/03 to evaluate change in mental status revealed a new right parietal infarct that may represent septic emboli ; however , on further evaluation it was thought that this was most likely a stroke , not really just sepsis .
There was no recommendation for further workup .
She was transferred to the floor on 1/5/03 , and by system :
1. ID :
She was continued to be treated for MSSA bacteremia and she should complete a 6 weeks course .
2. RENAL :
Patient slowly improved with her creatinine on the day of admission , still continuing to improve .
Secondary to all the IV fluids she received in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient has been having a goal of -1 L / day , which we have been able to accomplish successfully on Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , with extra doses of 80 mg IV as needed .
3. Cardiovascularly , patient , of note , had an EKG that had intermittent right bundle-branch block ; however , this recovered .
She does have known CAD from previous echos .
She has been stable .
She is on a beta blocker .
Her ACE inhibitor had been held , but may be restarted as soon as her creatinine normalizes .
4. NEUROLOGICAL :
Her head CT showed a right parietal infarct .
Patient should have an MRI as an outpatient to follow up .
Most likely represents an ischemic stroke .
Workup for B12 and RPR studies were all negative .
5. GI-wise , the patient had been started on tube feeds ; however , she recovered and NG tube was D / c&apos;d and patient taking p.o.&apos;s .
She was also started on lactulose to increase her bowel movements as needed .
Her ammonia level is normalized .
6. Heme-wise , her hematocrit remained stable .
7. Endocrine-wise , her sugars have been much improved and she continues on her NPH dose .
Plan for the long term is that the patient will receive six weeks of IV antibiotics .
She will return to see Dr. Ayan Koteskismanhout in orthopaedic surgery in 10-12 weeks for evaluation of the right shoulder and aspiration .
If the aspirate is negative and overall health is good , then she will consider implantation of hemiarthroscopy ; for now , she needs to continue in the sling .
For access , the patient will have a PICC line in order to continue IV fluids .
The discharge medications include albuterol nebulizer 2.5 q. 2 h. as needed , calcium carbonate 1250 b.i.d. , carbamazepine 100 p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 120 p.o. q. day , insulin sliding scale , lactulose 15-30 mL p.o. q.i.d. as needed .

He went to Padrugmoff Hospital Emergency Room .
He has a history of hypertension , diabetes , and high cholesterol .
In 2003 , he had a non ST elevation MI , came to the RWH , and had a cath done , which showed a 40% RCA , which was hazy .
An IVUS was done , and it was felt that it was more severe .
He underwent a PTC stenting of an RCA with a Vision stent , 3 x 18 .
Diagonal 1 also had a 99% stenosis .
There was no other noted disease .
Since then , the patient has occasional chest pain with emotional stress , when he is angry or upset .
