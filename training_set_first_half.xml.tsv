Major	O
consideration	O

with	O

who	O
presented	O
with	O
fever	O
,	O
four	O
days	O
of	O
diarrhea	O
,	O
nausea	O
and	O

and	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
Keflex	O
for	O
an	O
erythema	O
on	O
her	O
left	O
chest	O
wall	O
.	O
The	O
Keflex	O
was	O
stopped	O
when	O
she	O
developed	O
the	O
diarrhea	O
.	O
When	O
she	O
arrived	O
the	O
plan	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
treat	O
here	O
rythematous	O
induration	O
and	O
possible	O
cellulitis	O
with	O
IV	O
antibiotics	O
.	O
So	O
she	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
dicloxicillin	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
local	O
wound	O
care	O
with	O
an	O
agent	O
called	O
Santyl	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
collagenace	O
ondebrided	O
which	O
worked	O
very	O
well	O
for	O
her	O
.	O
Also	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
admission	O
we	O
were	O
also	O
considering	O
palliative	O
Taxol	O
chemotherapy	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
patient	O
declined	O
.	O
She	O
refused	O
the	O
Taxol	O
therapy	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
done	O
.	O
Another	O
major	O
issue	O
with	O
this	O
patient	O
was	O
pain	O
control	O
.	O
She	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
pain	O
from	O
her	O
left	O
arm	O
lesion	O
.	O
So	O
pain	O
control	O
was	O
a	O
big	O
issue	O
so	O
she	O
was	O
on	O
MS	O
Contin	O
and	O
MSIR	O
at	O
home	O
she	O
thought	O
that	O
clouded	O
her	O
thinking	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
tried	O
different	O
things	O
for	O
pain	O
management	O
.	O
One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
subarachnoid	O
neurologic	O
block	O
at	O
C6-C7	O
interface	O
on	O
1-6-94	DATE
.	O
After	O
that	O
the	O
patient	O
had	O
minimal	O
relief	O
of	O
pain	O
.	O
However	O
,	O
she	O
declined	O
further	O
blocks	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
offered	O
to	O
her	O
.	O
So	O
accepted	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
dilaudid	O
p.o.	O
which	O
was	O
started	O
at	O
a	O
dosage	O
of	O
2-4	O
meg	O
but	O
since	O
then	O
we	O
have	O
tapered	O
it	O
up	O
.	O
She	O
is	O
now	O
getting	O
dilaudid	O
8	O
mg	O
q2h	O
and	O
in	O
addition	O
she	O
has	O
been	O
on	O
fentanyl	O
patch	O
.	O
She	O
is	O
now	O
getting	O
75	O
micrograms	O
per	O
hour	O
of	O
the	O
fentanyl	O
patch	O
which	O
is	O
changed	O
every	O
72	O
hours	O
.	O
We	O
can	O
go	O
up	O
by	O
25	O
mg	O
on	O
the	O
fentanyl	O
patch	O
as	O
needed	O
to	O
control	O
her	O
pain	O
and	O
we	O
can	O
always	O
go	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
dilaudid	O
because	O
she	O
is	O
still	O
in	O
considerable	O
amount	O
of	O
pain	O
.	O
Other	O
things	O
that	O
happened	O
during	O
this	O
admission	O
-	O
we	O
obtained	O
ahead	O
CT	O
for	O
her	O
on	O
the	O
8th	DATE
of	DATE
January	DATE
because	O
of	O
her	O
clouded	O
thinking	O
and	O
altered	O
mental	O
status	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
probably	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
morphine	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
taking	O
.	O
We	O
went	O
ahead	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
head	O
CT	O
scanand	O
it	O
showed	O
no	O
enhancing	O
lesions	O
.	O
In	O
addition	O
her	O
liver	O
transaminases	O
were	O
elevated	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
about	O
doing	O
further	O
work-up	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
deferred	O
because	O
the	O
patient	O
wanted	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O
that	O
.	O
That	O
has	O
been	O
stable	O
.	O
The	O
patient	O
on	O
January	DATE
13	DATE
became	O
hyponatremic	O
.	O
Her	O
sodium	O
went	O
down	O
to	O
121	O
and	O
before	O
that	O
on	O
admission	O
she	O
was	O
133	O
.	O
A	O
renal	O
consult	O
was	O
obtained	O
and	O
their	O
assessment	O
was	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
probably	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
hypovolemia	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
SIADH	O
.	O
We	O
proceeded	O
to	O
do	O
for	O
her	O
hyponatremia	O
-	O
we	O
gave	O
her	O
some	O
fluid	O
and	O
her	O
urine	O
sodium	O
became	O
higher	O
than	O
her	O
serum	O
sodium	O
;	O
we	O
stopped	O
it	O
.	O
We	O
had	O
given	O
her	O
some	O
normal	O
saline	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
just	O
do	O
fluid	O
restriction	O
.	O
In	O
addition	O
we	O
gave	O
her	O
a	O
sodium	O
chloride	O
one	O
gram	O
per	O
day	O
and	O
that	O
also	O
helped	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
discharge	O
,	O
the	O
patient	O
&apos;s	O
sodium	O
is	O
between	O
126	O
and	O
129	O
;	O
prior	O
to	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
gone	O
down	O
to	O
as	O
low	O
116.	O
So	O
that	O
has	O
really	O
improved	O
.	O
We	O
suggest	O
continuing	O
increased	O
salt	O
intake	O
in	O
her	O
diet	O
and	O
also	O
continuing	O
with	O
the	O
fluid	O
restriction	O
of	O
free	O
water	O
intake	O
to	O
one	O
liter	O
per	O
day	O
.	O
On	O
the	O
14th	DATE
of	DATE
January	DATE
,	O
the	O
patient	O
developed	O
increased	O
shortness	O
of	O
breath	O
and	O
chest	O
x-ray	O
was	O
taken	O
showed	O
a	O
wedge	O
shaped	O
infiltrate	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
upper	O
lobe	O
which	O
was	O
consistent	O
with	O
Hampton	O
&apos;s	O
hump	O
.	O
Also	O
a	O
VQ	O
scan	O
obtained	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
showed	O
high	O
probability	O
for	O
PE	O
.	O
So	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
heparin	O
for	O
anticoagulation	O
and	O
then	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
therapeutic	O
on	O
heparin	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
ahead	O
and	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
coumadin	O
and	O
she	O
is	O
currently	O
on	O
coumadin	O
at	O
2.5	O
mg	O
q.h.s.	O
Her	O
INR	O
is	O
2.3	O
.	O
We	O
want	O
her	O
INR	O
to	O
remain	O
between	O
2	O
and	O
3	O
.	O
So	O
if	O
it	O
goes	O
much	O
lower	O
than	O
2	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
would	O
consider	O
increasing	O
it	O
to	O
perhaps	O
coumadin	O
2.5	O
and	O
5	O
alternating	O
every	O
other	O
night	O
.	O
However	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
leave	O
it	O
at	O
2.5	O
for	O
now	O
.	O
Other	O
major	O
issues	O
-	O
As	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
things	O
happened	O
and	O
with	O
her	O
hyponatremia	O
and	O
also	O
the	O
other	O
problems	O
,	O
her	O
blood	O
pressure	O
was	O
elevated	O
also	O
.	O
We	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
nifedipine	O
IR	O
,	O
SL	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
control	O
her	O
blood	O
pressure	O
which	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
200s	O
in	O
the	O
systolic	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
atenolol	O
.	O
So	O
on	O
discharge	O
she	O
is	O
on	O
atenolol	O
100	O
.	O
If	O
needed	O
to	O
you	O
can	O
give	O
her	O
some	O
nifedipine	O
SL	O
to	O
decrease	O
her	O
blood	O
pressure	O
.	O
The	O
patient	O
also	O
has	O
significant	O

both	O
arms	O
now	O
and	O
also	O
some	O
mild	O
edema	O
in	O
the	O
lower	O

so	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
