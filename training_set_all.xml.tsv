here	O
rythematous	O

she	O

pain	O

she	O

at	O

she	O
thought	O
that	O

so	O
we	O
tried	O
different	O

One	O
of	O

was	O

accepted	O

the	O

on	O
the	O

as	O
needed	O

we	O
can	O
always	O
go	O
up	O

than	O
her	O
serum	O
sodium	O
;	O
we	O
stopped	O
it	O
.	O
We	O
had	O
given	O
her	O
some	O
normal	O
saline	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
just	O
do	O
fluid	O
restriction	O
.	O
In	O
addition	O
we	O
gave	O
her	O
a	O
sodium	O
chloride	O
one	O
gram	O
per	O
day	O
and	O
that	O
also	O
helped	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
discharge	O
,	O
the	O
patient	O
&apos;s	O
sodium	O
is	O
between	O
126	O
and	O
129	O
;	O
prior	O
to	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
gone	O
down	O
to	O
as	O
low	O
116.	O
So	O
that	O
has	O
really	O
improved	O
.	O
We	O
suggest	O
continuing	O
increased	O
salt	O
intake	O
in	O
her	O
diet	O
and	O
also	O
continuing	O
with	O
the	O
fluid	O
restriction	O
of	O
free	O
water	O
intake	O
to	O
one	O
liter	O
per	O
day	O
.	O
On	O
the	O
14th	DATE
of	DATE
January	DATE
,	O
the	O
patient	O
developed	O
increased	O
shortness	O
of	O
breath	O
and	O
chest	O
x-ray	O
was	O
taken	O
showed	O
a	O
wedge	O
shaped	O
infiltrate	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
upper	O
lobe	O
which	O
was	O
consistent	O
with	O
Hampton	O
&apos;s	O
hump	O
.	O
Also	O
a	O
VQ	O
scan	O
obtained	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
showed	O
high	O
probability	O
for	O
PE	O
.	O
So	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
heparin	O
for	O
anticoagulation	O
and	O
then	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
therapeutic	O
on	O
heparin	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
ahead	O
and	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
coumadin	O
and	O
she	O
is	O
currently	O
on	O
coumadin	O
at	O
2.5	O
mg	O
q.h.s.	O
Her	O
INR	O
is	O
2.3	O
.	O
We	O
want	O
her	O
INR	O
to	O
remain	O
between	O
2	O
and	O
3	O
.	O
So	O
if	O
it	O
goes	O
much	O
lower	O
than	O
2	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
would	O
consider	O
increasing	O
it	O
to	O
perhaps	O
coumadin	O
2.5	O
and	O
5	O
alternating	O
every	O
other	O
night	O
.	O
However	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
leave	O
it	O
at	O
2.5	O
for	O
now	O
.	O
Other	O
major	O
issues	O
-	O
As	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
things	O
happened	O
and	O
with	O
her	O
hyponatremia	O
and	O
also	O
the	O
other	O
problems	O
,	O
her	O
blood	O
pressure	O
was	O
elevated	O
also	O
.	O
We	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
nifedipine	O
IR	O
,	O
SL	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
control	O
her	O
blood	O
pressure	O
which	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
200s	O
in	O
the	O
systolic	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
atenolol	O
.	O
So	O
on	O
discharge	O
she	O
is	O
on	O
atenolol	O
100	O
.	O
If	O
needed	O
to	O
you	O
can	O
give	O
her	O
some	O
nifedipine	O
SL	O
to	O
decrease	O
her	O
blood	O
pressure	O
.	O
The	O
patient	O
also	O
has	O
significant	O
edema	O
in	O
both	O
arms	O
now	O
and	O
also	O
some	O
mild	O
edema	O
in	O
the	O
lower	O
extremities	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
fluid	O

should	O
help	O
