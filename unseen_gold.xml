The patient underwent dialysis AV graft thrombectomy and this was complicated by poor result due to stenosis and fibrosed nature of graft .
She subsequently had swelling of her left arm and ongoing hyperkalemia which was managed with Kayexalate .
She was admitted to reestablish dialysis angio access and to optimize dialysis indices .
PREVIOUS HISTORY :
1. Endstage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease status post failed transplant on chronic hemodialysis at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> .

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Potassium 6.3 down to 4.8 , calcium 8.3 , phosphorus 5 .
BUN 35 , creatinine 5.9 , hematocrit 34.9 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Dialysis :
She received dialysis via a remnant of her AV graft but clearance was suboptimal and graft will not be usable over the long-term .
She was therefore referred for a dialysis tunneled angiocatheter and will be seen by the surgical service as an outpatient for elective revision of her AV graft surgically .
Her potassium was stable postdialysis in the 4 range .
Her hematocrit was however low and with followup pending .
The patient has chronic outpatient dialysis at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> and communication regarding her angio access status will be performed .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease .
She had labile blood pressure following dialysis likely related to fluid removal and then sedating medications for catheter placement .
She resolved spontaneously with small fluid bolus and with no further difficulties .
3. Metabolic :
Hyperkalemia as noted .
Now stable with reestablishment of vascular access .
Anemia :
Probably a component of CKD , dilutional and blood loss with procedures .
Pending reevaluation will be monitored in an outpatient setting .
Increase dose of EPO .
No need for transfusion at this stage given the patient is asymptomatic and no episodes of GI bleeding documented .
The patient will follow up with her primary nephrologist at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> and with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">N Tland</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">DH</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
30 WEEKS GESTATION , PREMATURE LABOR
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
30 WEEKS GESTATION , PREMATURE LABOR STATUS POST CESAREAN SECTION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida-2 para-0 with a known twin gestation with an estimated date of confinement of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/27</PHI>/98 .
On the day of admission , the patient had an ultrasound which showed the infants to be in the breech /vertex presentation .
Also noted on ultrasound was a shortened cervix at 1.8 centimeters and funneling of the lower uterine segment .
The patient was admitted to the triage area of labor and delivery and noted to be having contractions every two minutes .
She was given one dose of terbutaline with a subsequent tachycardia to 120 .
She was then started on magnesium sulfate with a 4 gram bolus followed by two grams per hour .
This seemed to decrease the frequency of her contractions significantly and she was only having a rare contraction .
Her cervix on admission was closed and about 80 percent effaced .
She was given betamethasone and transferred to the antenatal unit .
She did well for the first two days with only minor complaints of irregular contractions .
On the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24</PHI>/98 she seemed to be having more contractions and pelvic exam revealed the cervix to be one centimeter , 80 percent effaced .
Consultation was obtained with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lou</PHI> who suggested at least briefly increasing the infusion rate to see if her pregnancy could be prolonged longer .
She seemed to respond to this with only irregular contractions .
On the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24</PHI>/98 , the patient once again complained of increasing contraction frequency as well as back pain .
Examination revealed the cervix to now be 2-3 centimeters dilated and the decision was made to discontinue the magnesium and to perform delivery .
She had a primary Cesarean section because of the breech presentation and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Christmas</PHI> she underwent uncomplicated primary Monroe Kerr Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia .
At 2:10 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/25</PHI>/98 the patient was delivered of a 3 pound 5 ounce male infant with Apgars of 7 at one and 8 at five minutes .
At 2:12 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/25</PHI>/98 she was delivered of a male infant weighing 3 pounds and 3 ounces in the vertex position with Apgars of 7 at one and 7 at five minutes .
Both infants were transferred to the Neonatal intensive care unit and were doing well at the time of the maternal discharge .
She did well postoperatively with minimal discomfort .
On the morning of discharge , the patient complained of a warm swollen area on the posterior aspect of her left knee .
Consultation was obtained with the cardiovascular group and the decision was that she had superficial phlebitis of her left leg which could be treated conservatively and would not require Heparin .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/29</PHI>/98 and is to be seen in the office in two weeks .
She was discharged with prescriptions for Motrin and Tylenol and Peri-Colace as needed .
She is to attemp elevation , heatetc to her left leg understanding that she will be coming to see her infants in the NICU .

CC :
Atypical CP 54 yo smoker , hx of hyperlipidemia , htn , DM , TAH / BSO age 48 , and hx of atypical cp .
She presented in 1999 and stress-ECHO , she exercised 9.5 min without pain , ECHO was nl with no wall motional abn , but EKG showed 1mm ST depressions .
In 2001 , she again p / w CP and ETT again showed 1mm ST depression , exercised 9min .

While waiting for LENI &apos;s in ED , she developed CP , similar to old pain , in low sub-sternal area radiating to left shoulder , no EKG changes .
An ETT was done--pt exercised 9.5 min and there was 2mm ST depression inferiorly and laterally where persisted for 10 minutes during rest .
Enzymes flat .
*** Initial Plan *** ***
CV isch :
Pt has sig risk factors for CAD .
But given no symptoms during exercise x 9.5 min and neg enzymes after exercise , CP is likely not CAD .
However , she is still at high risk for CAD .
Will plan for Cath on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/24</PHI> .
Cont ASA , Lopressor , Zocor .
*** Vasc :
LENI &apos;s to rule out DVT of R leg
*** Endo :
CZI sliding scale .
*** Hosp course ***
Enzymes were flat x3 and pt was ruled out for MI .
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed clean coronary arteries .
Therefore , she pain was not cardiac .
It is important to note in the future that she physiologically develops 1-2 mm ST depressions during ETT and she reports no pain during ETT .
She should have Stress MIBI or Stress ECHO if there is suspicion of CAD in to future .
Lower extremitiy non-invasives were performed for the R leg &quot; heat &quot; which were negative .

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS :
1. Visceral segment aorticpseudoaneurysm .
2. Severe restrictive pulmonary disease secondary to kyphosis .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Same .
ADMITTING SURGEON :
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nonok Ayrekempe</PHI> , M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 78-year-old man who was diagnosed with a very large perirenal abdominal aortic pseudo- aneurysm on a CT scan that was ordered in the setting of dyspnea in .
The patient did have a history of previous AAA repair , and the CT revealed a large pseudoaneurysm in the area of the prior proximal anastomosis .
Given the size of the aneurysm , the patient was scheduled for a repair of the pseudoaneurysm .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Peripheral vascular disease .
2. History of DVT .
3. History of PE in 1997 .
4. Paraesophageal hernia .
5. History of TB which was treated in 1950&apos;s.
6. Kyphosis and osteoporosis .
7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease .
8. Upper GI bleed in 1997 .
9. Occasional dyspnea with mild aortic insufficiency .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
1. Triple-A repair in 1999 .
2. Paraesophageal hernia repair in 1997 .
3. ORIF of left hip in 1975 .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME :
1. Atenolol 50 q.d.
2. Fosamax 70 q.week .
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 20 q.d.
4. Nexium 20 q.d.
5. Zocor 20 q.h.s.
6. MVI q.d.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/16</PHI>/04 where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with attempted repair of a perirenal aortic aneurysm which was subsequently aborted given the patient &apos;s complex aortic anatomy and the extensive scar encountered .
The patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
Please see operative note for more details .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration and respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU transfer .
The patient was noted to have a distal esophageal stricture near the site the of the prior paraesophageal hernia repair with a large esophageal dilation above that area .
This was thought to be the source of his multiple episodes of aspiration .
The patient underwent extensive treatment in both the ICU and the floor , which eventually resulted in extubation and placement of a PEG tube in order to pexy the stomach within the abdominal cavity .
This was achieved with good success , and the patient remained extubated on the floor for several days postoperatively .
However , on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/5</PHI>/04 the patient did suffer what appeared to be another aspiration event , became hypoxic and a code was called .
The patient was intubated and placed on pressors after administration of the ACLS protocol .
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent multiple rounds of the ACLS protocol without resolution of his hypotension , bradycardia or hypoxia .
After his aspiration event it was noted that the patient did develop ST elevation in the inferolateral leads .
Cardiology was consulted ; however , it was felt that this event was secondary to an aspiration event and therefore not a primary cardiac event .
Decision was made not to take him to the Cath Lab , but to medically manage him only .
Multiple attempts were made to resuscitate the patient using the ACLS protocol , which were unsuccessful in the setting of his coronary ischemia .
After extensive attempts at resuscitation it was noted that we were dealing with a reversible ischemia , and at that time the team did discuss further management with his family .
The patient &apos;s daughter did understand the current situation and understood that additional resuscitation attempts would be considered futile .
Despite administration of additional medications the patient remained hypotensive and bradycardic , and eventually became asystolic at 8:20 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/5</PHI>/04 .
The family was at the bedside at this time .
The medical examiner has been contacted and a post has been requested .

IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
This is a 63-year-old lady with stage IV colon cancer , status post three chemo regimens , then she was on a phase one trial .
She presented with increasing LFTs and renal failure .
1. Hypertension , infectious disease .
The patient was hypertensive to 60s through much of her stay .
She had E. coli in her urine and she was placed on Levaquin .
Differential diagnosis included urosepsis and intravascular sleep depletion .
Because of her rising LFTs and renal failure , she was thought to be in hepatorenal , see below .
We continued to administer serum-poor albumin throughout the day even until her death .
2. Renal failure .
The patient was in acute renal failure and had hypertension .
The differential diagnosis included hypertension , hypovolemia , and nephrotoxicity due to the drug , and tumor lysis leading to hepatorenal or hepatorenal in itself .
The patient had a renal ultrasound .
This showed mild left hydronephrosis , no real etiology for this .
Her creatinine is slowly climbed to greater than 4.6 upon her death .
She was in fluid restriction to 1.5 litres a day .
Renal failure was thought likely to be due to hypovolemia from hyperperfusion as well as hepatorenal syndrome .
We continued allopurinol .
3. Increasing LFTs and INR .
The patient had increasing LFTs and her T. bili climbed to greater than 9 upon death .
This is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome .
Also , the patient could have had the tumor metabolizing .
There was no evidence of obstruction .
4. The patient &apos;s increased LDH , uric acid , and BUN and creatinine are all consistent with tumor lysis .
This is likely thought to be due to an increased tumor burden and not necessarily from the medication .
It became clear throughout the patient &apos;s hospital course that she was becoming very sick and the patient accepted this .
With her wishes that her she was DNR / DNI , we eventually made her CMO , comfort measures only .
She was awake and entertaining friends and family through most of her hospital stay .
She often may talk openly about her death that was impending .
On the two days prior to her death , she was more unresponsive and on the day of her death , she was unconscious through most of the day .
The patient was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/16</PHI>/05 .
One of her sons and her nephew were present in the room .
The family decline autopsy and the chaplain visited .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Orthostatic hypotension .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
Hyponatremia .
Hypokalemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Middso Memorial Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness .
During the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting .
She felt that she was profoundly cold at the time .
In the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing .
The patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .
Over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .
Stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU on Dopamine for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida V , para V .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day .
She also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily .
She is married and lives with her husband .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an agitated elderly white female .
Temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on Dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather .
HEENT :
Showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light .
Extraocular muscles intact .
Oropharynx benign .
Eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning .
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
Carotids were 2+ .
No palpable thyroid .
Lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally .
Cardiac exam revealed S1 , S2 with an intermittent S4 without murmur or rubs .
Abdominal exam was benign .
Extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema .
Neurologic exam :
The patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities .
Light touch was intact .
ADMISSION LABS :
Sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos .
Platelets 310 .
PT and PTT were normal .
LFT &apos;s were within normal limits .
Admission cortisol , aldosterone , B12 and folate and TSH were drawn .
Chest x-ray on transfer to the MICU showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In the MICU , the patient initially required Dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .
Echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 .
Because the Swan-Ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with Cefotaxime , Gentamicin and Flagyl .
All cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an E coli UTI .
The infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .
The patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .
Because Addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose Cortisone .
However , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .
The patient also responded appropriately to Cortrosyn stimulation test .
Also , TSH was normal on admission .
Thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on Dopamine was subsequently abnormal .
However , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .
The patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .
EMG showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .
Additional studies also included a head CT that showed a small Lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head MRI .
Other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .
LH and SSH levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .
Galactin levels were within normal limits .
ANA was negative .
Ace level was negative .
Heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .
An anti-YO RI and WHO antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .
On hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off Dopamine and was transferred to the floor .
At that time , the stress dose Hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to Prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .
Her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .
In the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .
The patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .
Subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .
Because of the patient &apos;s significant smoking history , chest PT was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .
However , the chest CT showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .
The patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .
Prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest CT included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .
Because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest CT would be best evaluated as an out-patient .
A new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .
She will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .
Multi-vitamin one p.o. q day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be discharged to home .
She will follow-up with <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jacrendonate Sella</PHI> , M.D. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/6</PHI>/95 .
She will need a pulmonary referral and pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
At the time of discharge , studies that were pending included a repeat thyroid function panel , aldosterone levels and anti-WHO and anti-YO and RI antibodies .

#9. Hypothyroidism .
#10. noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
#11. Adult failure to thrive .
PROCEDURE :
Radiotherapy to the esophagus on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/13</PHI>/03 for four consecutive days .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several admissions for this 72 year-old female with metastatic unresectable esophageal cancer who is admitted with generalized upper abdominal pain of several days duration .
We have been seeing her fairly frequently in clinic , trying to give her some palliative chemotherapy which did not seem to work ( platinum and 5FU ) and she has had an anemia requiring transfusions on a regular basis every few weeks with heme positive stools .
On the days leading up to her admission she had not had many bowel movements but forced one with laxatives the night before admission .
The abdominal pain was slightly better after defecation but was not really influenced much by position or eating .
The bowel movement was dark .
She had nausea .
She was regurgitating some of her saliva from the lesion in her esophagus that was preventing her from swallowing .
She had some dyspnea that was continuing in spite of transfusions .
Her exam showed a blood pressure of 126/68 , heart rate 72 and regular , temperature 98.8 .
Her pain level was rated a 5 out of 10 .
She was pale and exhausted .
Old ecchymoses from a recent fall were resolving on her face and the laceration on her nasal bridge was also covered with scab .
Her tongue was moist .
Her JVP was less than 6 cm .
Her lungs were clear .
There was a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base .
Her abdomen was softly protuberant .
There was a few tingling bowel sounds .
The liver is 10 below the right costal margin at the MCL , firm and tender .
No hepatic rub .
Rectal ; good tone , empty vault but the material present is dark brown and guaiac positive .
Neuro exam ; positive for generalized weakness / deconditioning , but cranial nerves and mentation were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included an abdominal film that showed nonspecific gas pattern .
Her sodium was 130 , potassium 4.2 , her BUN was 27 , creatinine 0.8 .
Her plasma glucose was 409 , her albumin 1.6 .
Her alk phos 816 .
ALT 53 , AST 113 , LDH 699 , white blood count was 17.3 with 85 polys , 12 lymphs , no bands .
Her crit was 21.6 and her platelets were 100,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was brought into the hospital and begun on IV fluids along with some clear liquids if she could tolerate them and her condition did not really improve , although she would keep reporting that each day she was a little bit better .
She was really too weak to get out of bed .
She only picked at her food and still had some dysphagia for solids .
Because of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and transfusions , we suspected that the esophageal lesion itself was probably the source of this bleeding and perhaps some palliative radiation therapy would both open the sphincter area for swallowing and staunch the bleeding .
To that end , external beam radiation therapy was begun and she tolerated it fairly well .
Some episodes of nausea , but only received about four or five doses of it without any marked change in how she felt .
Over this period of time , there has been tentative plans to try to get her closer to home to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lida Shonic,nsol Memorial Hospital</PHI> home or even to her own home , to be able to died in her own bed but this was not possible because the family felt uncertain about being able to provide enough safe care for her , even for a brief period of time .
Ultimately she became jaundiced and encephalopathic and the decision was to let her stay in the hospital .
She had previously established that she did not want resuscitation or intubation and this was abided by and she passed away in her sleep at 6:45 am on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/22</PHI>/03 .
The family was not interested in having an autopsy .

He was admitted to the hospital and underwent a workup for modifiable stroke risk factors .
His stroke syndrome was lacunar .
He ruled out for an MI .
His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm .
He had a Holter study , report of which is pending at this time .
His lipids were checked and were found to be elevated , so his lipitor dose was increased from 20 milligrams to 40 milligrams .

asthma .
HISTORY :
52-year-old female , with a history of of nonsteroid dependent asthma , presenting with chest discomfort .
The patient stated that the previous week while in a pulmonary rehabilitation program , she underwent an exercise tolerance test .
During the procedure , she complained of a squeezing sensation in the chest , apparently associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The day of admission , she noted the onset of the same chest pressure , radiating to the right shoulder , which she described as an &quot; awful feeling in her chest . &quot;
This lasted several hours and was relieved in the Emergency Department .
Mild nausea but not other cardiac related symptoms .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
history of cigarette use , post menopausal , hypercholesterolemia .
In 1991 , she had an equivocal exercise tolerance test with a normal thallium study .
The patient also described a long history of &quot; cold weather &quot; exertion related chest discomfort that involved her &quot; sternum , back and insides , &quot; associated with asthma but not relieved by metered dose inhalers .
This symptoms she reports has been stable for years and was different than her presenting complaints .
On PHYSICAL EXAMINATION , 110/80 bilaterally , 68 , 18 .
Black female in no apparent distress .
Chest clear to auscultation .

ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES :
complete blood count , electrolytes , creatinine normal .
This 52-year-old patient with a history of asthma , atypical chest pain , and recently positive exercise tolerance test was admitted to the medical service with a similar chest pain , which was not associated with electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by creatine kinase enzymes .
Given the similarity of her current presentation to her recent positive stress test , and wish to avoid beta blockade , due to her asthma , an inpatient thallium study was ordered .
While in the hospital she remained pain free .
She exhibited no bronchospasm while taking enteric coated aspirin .
When an exercise thallium study was unable to be obtained 48 hours after admission , the patient was discharged to follow up for an out patient study and with her internist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kanner</PHI> .
At discharge , she looked and felt well .

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 27</PHI> , 2006 , Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Straight</PHI> underwent pelviscopy that was converted to a laparotomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy , lysis of adhesions , right ileal resection with primary reanastomosis and appendectomy .
Please refer to operative report dictation for full details of the operative course .
Briefly , there is noted to be dense adhesions involving the ileum , the appendix , cecum , pelvic cystic mass and the right ovary .
In the course of lysis of adhesions a small enterotomy in ileum was noted .
General surgical consultation was obtained from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Obe</PHI> who performed lysis of ileal adhesions with another small enterotomy secondary to dense adhesions .
An approximately 3-4 cm segment of the ileum was resected with a primary end to end reanastomosis .
The estimated blood loss was 200 ml .
The final surgical pathology showed a right hemorrhagic cyst of undetermined origin with extensive adhesions , peri-appendiceal adhesions and ileum with adhesions .
Postoperatively , Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Straight</PHI> was maintained with an NG tube and bowel rest until postoperative day #5 when she passed flatus .
Of note , on postoperative day #3 and #4 , she spiked isolated temperatures to 101 .
Evaluation was unrevealing in terms of focal source of her fever .
The urine and blood cultures were negative .
Chest x-ray was negative .
After postoperative day #4 , she experienced no further episodes of fever .
Following her NG tube discontinuation on postoperative day #5 , she experienced three to four episodes of bilious emesis .
On examination , her abdomen was nondistended and she had normal bowel sounds .
A KUB confirmed no evidence of an ileus or obstruction .
She was managed conservatively and kept npo for one night and then her diet was advanced slowly .
By the evening of postoperative day #7 , she was tolerating full house diet and had two spontaneous bowel movements .
It was unclear her etiology of her emesis following NG tube removal although possibly secondary to a subclinical ileus .
It is also a possibility that she had gastroenteritis from her relative who had presented recently to the ED with similar course of low grade fevers , emesis that resolved in short course .
At time of discharge ( postoperative day #8 <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/04</PHI>/06 ) , she was tolerating a house diet .

DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Cimetidine 400 mg po b.i.d. ; aspirin 80 mg po q.d. ; Ventolin two puffs q.i.d. ;
WORK DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :
Permanent .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75-year-old right handed man with a past history of migraine , peripheral neuropathy , gait ataxia , and microvascular leukomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging study , was admitted because of an abrupt worsening of walking .
He had a history of progressive gait ataxia since 1989 , worsening over the past few months , and a recent decline in memory and concentration .
Migraine headaches with visual changes , headache and photophobia had been present for many years .
A peripheral neuropathy was first diagnosed in 1989 , cause undetermined .
Increased imbalance occurred in 1991 , at which time he was unable to walk tandem and swayed on the Romberg test .
Thoracic and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging study were normal .
Brain magnetic resonance imaging study showed atrophy and microvascular leukomalacia .
He had an episode of headache , flashing light , confusion and possible loss of consciousness in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 1993 , at which time an magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was unchanged and MRA was negative .
Memory , gait and occasional urinary incontinence worsened after that time .
The present admission was prompted by an episode of inability to walk at all for the past two or three days .
A computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pulse 72 and regular .
Blood pressure 154/90 .
He was alert and fully oriented , but had some trouble remembering current events and made one error in the Tom and Bill story after ten minutes .
There was no aphasia .
He was unable to get up from the bed without help .
Gait was quite ataxic , with short steps , requiring support , but no freezing in place .
He swayed backward on the Romberg test .
Upward gaze was decreased .
Cranial nerves otherwise normal .
Slight left iliopsoas weakness .
Tendon reflex is absent .
Plantars withal , possibly bilaterally extensor .
No Hoffmann reflexes .
No frontal lobe release signs .
Coordination normal .
Mild decreased vibration and position sense in the toes .
Pin prick sensation decreased below the ankles .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
The computerized tomography scan showed the findings described above .
A therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 5</PHI> , at which time 40 cc were removed .
The cerebrospinal fluid was benign .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly less unsteadiness , but no change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was felt that this response and the presentation raised a definite question of symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus , but that this could not be diagnosed definitely at this time .
It was decided to continue to follow Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeshuff</PHI> on an outpatient basis , with a follow up appointment in one month .
If there is significant deterioration of gait , shunt treatment will be reconsidered .

Three weeks prior to admission , he noticed substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He did not have any arrest .
Two days prior to admission , he was seen by his local M.D. for the above symptoms .
19 days prior to admission , he was found to have a mass in the right upper lung on chest x-ray .
Nine days prior to admission , a CT and biopsy showed a large cell cancer .
Four days prior to admission , a bone scan showed right lateral rib positive .
Two days prior to admission to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Camweissallcoa Medical Center</PHI> , he developed 3/6 substernal chest pain which lasted 20-30 minutes .
He had shortness of breath .
He had nausea and diaphoresis .

The abdominal exam revealed bowel sounds present .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Potassium 3.3 ; creatinine 1.5 ; hematocrit 38.0 ; white count 65,000 ; platelets 445,000 .
The chest x-ray showed the right upper lung mass .
A Swan showed a PA of 40/21 , a wedge of 17 , cardiac output 3.8 and index 2.3 .
He was on 2 mcg of dopamine .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the ICU and was fully monitored with an A-line and Swan .
He was taken to cardiac cath where he was found to have a total occlusion of his LAD after his first diagonal .
His circumflex had a 60% obstruction prior to the obtuse marginal branch with a 60% stenosis of the obtuse marginal branch .
The obtuse marginal second branch was subtotally occluded .
The RCA had an 80% stenosis in its mid portion and 40% distal obstruction .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
It was considered that too much time had elapsed since his infarction and nothing was to be gained by revascularizing this infarct zone .
He was then stabilized medically in preparation for surgery .
He did eventually then go to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/14</PHI>/90 , at which time he had an emergency CABG times three with asaphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and one onto the PDA .

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3/25</PHI>/93
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">4/4</PHI>/93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
congestive heart failure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
cardiac catheterization - <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/25</PHI>/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , 1992 .
Later , an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
LABORATORY DATA :
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 .
At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Patella</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> &apos;s management .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .
He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

Sensory exam is intact to light touch and pinprick .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with suspected metastatic lung cancer to the left proximal femur .
She underwent chest and abdominal CT .
The chest CT revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the right middle lobe , consistent with neoplastic disease .
CT was carried out to the level of the adrenals and kidneys , which appeared normal .
She underwent an open biopsy and bipolar hemiarthroplasty on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/27</PHI> without complication .
The frozen section revealed adenocarcinoma with characteristics most likely attributed to lung rather than the GI tract for primary site , based on the frozen section .
Final pathology was pending at the time of discharge .
She did well and progressed with physical therapy and was able to do stairs with crutches , ambulating with a walker by postoperative day # 5 .
She was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Breunspeelm</PHI> from Oncology , who felt that most likely it was metastatic lung cancer to the bone ; however , breast cancer remains a possibility .
He also noted that if it is metastatic breast cancer it is a more treatable condition .
He recommended that we check the ER status of the pathology , which we plan to do , and get a mammogram .
He also recommended considering radiotherapy to the lung lesion .
He also recommended that she be switched from Premarin to tamoxifen .
She also receivd an Occupational Therapy consultation .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Larsen</PHI> was a 50-year-old salesman who in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26</PHI> was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/07</PHI>/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count of 24.409 and platelets of 956,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/12</PHI>/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/24</PHI>/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/26</PHI>/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI>/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/02</PHI>/00 .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
MR. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">STERPSAP</PHI> IS A 43 YEAR OLD MALE WITH PROSTHETIC VALVE ENDOCARDITIS .
HIS HISTORY BEGAN IN <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> OF 1987 WHEN HE DEVELOPED STREPTOCOCCAL ENDOCARDITIS SECONDARY TO INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSE .
HE HAD SEVERE AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY AND A SMALL EMBOLIC EVENT .
HE WAS TREATED WITH THREE WEEKS OF ANTIBIOTICS AND THEN UNDERWENT AN AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/25</PHI>/1988 ( <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PEERGNONY HEALTHCARE</PHI> ) BY DR. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">KOTE</PHI> .
HE DID WELL , BUT CONTINUED TO USE INTRAVENOUS DRUGS .
IN 1999 HE AGAIN DEVELOPED ENDOCARDITIS .
HE WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS AND HAS NOT USED DRUGS SINCE .
HE WAS WELL UNTIL <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> OF 2001 WHEN HE BECAME FEBRILE .
BLOOD CULTURES WERE POSITIVE FOR S. VERIDANS .
A SIX WEEK COURSE OF CEFTRIAXONE AND GENTAMYCIN WAS ADMINISTERED .
FOLLOW-UP BLOOD CULTURES WERE POSITIVE FOR A NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENT STREPTOCOCCAL ORGANISM .
A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHO DONE AT THIS TIME SHOWED AN AORTIC PERIVALVULAR LEAK .
DR. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">SKOLKRIB</PHI> OF THE <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">RIB HOSPITAL</PHI> SAW HIM AND FELT THAT WITH HIS PAST HISTORY OF DRUG ABUSE , THAT HE WAS NOT A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR REPEAT SURGERY .
THE PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH CEFTRIAXONE AND RIFAMPIN .
ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/25</PHI>/01 HE DEVELOPED COOLNESS IN HIS LEFT ARM AND HAND .
HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A LEFT BRACHIAL ARTERY EMBOLUS .
HE UNDERWENT A LEFT BRACHIAL ARTERY EMBOLECTOMY .
PATHOLOGY WAS CONSISTENT WITH A VEGETATION BUT NO SPECIFIC ORGANISM WAS FOUND AND BLOOD CULTURES WERE NEGATIVE .
HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">DUATE HEALTH</PHI> ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/2</PHI>/2001 AND PLACED ON AMPICILLIN AND GENTAMICIN .
A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/3</PHI>/01 SHOWED POSSIBLE VEGETATION ON THE VALVE AND A MILD PERIVALVULAR LEAK .
HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO A MARINER NURSING HOME TO COMPLETE HIS SIX WEEK COURSE OF INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS .
HE WAS REFERRED BACK TO DR. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">KOTE</PHI> FOR REDO AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT .
PREOPERATIVE WORKUP INCLUDED A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/23</PHI>/01 SHOWED ROCKING OF THE POSTERIOR SEWING RING OF THE TILTING DISC VALVE .
THERE WAS A 1.1 CENTIMETER VEGETATION ON THE VALVE THAT PROLAPSED INTO LEFT VENTRICLE OUTFLOW TRACT DURING DIASTOLE .
SEVERE PARAVALVULAR AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY WAS NOTED AS WELL AS A DILATED , HYPOKINETIC LEFT VENTRICLE AND AN EJECTION FRACTION OF 45% .

He had normal finger to nose .
LABORATORY DATA :
unremarkable
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Neuro :
The patient was started on heparin for concern of embolic ACA stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation or possibly artery to artery embolus given his left carotid stenosis .
The patient continued on hemodialysis .
He was seen by Interventional NeuroRadiology who recommended a CTA to better visualize question of left ICA stenosis .
CTA revealed patent ACA &apos;s with dominant left A1 segment , hypoplastic right A1 segment but good filling of anterior cerebrals bilaterally .
It did show stenosis of the left carotid proximal to the cavernous portion .
However it did show contrast throughout .
It was thought by NeuroRadiology that this lesion given its proximity to the petrous portion in bone would not be amenable to stenting .
Given the embolic appearance of the stroke the patient was changed from heparin to Plavix and aspirin for anticoagulation .
He was not placed on Coumadin given discussion with his primary care doctor and history of multiple GI bleeds on aspirin alone .
2. Renal :
He contined on hemodialysis and was started on Renogel and Nephrocaps for high phosphorus levels .
3. GI :
He was started on Nexium in addition to Zantac for further GI prophylaxis .
4. Thyroid mass :
on CTA pt. was noted to have incidental mass of left thyroid gland .
Recommended to have a thyroid fine needle biopsy for further evaluation .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Chiybelb</PHI> will be notified of this finding for follow up .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 79 year old female whose cardiac risk factors include hyperlipidemia , hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , positive family history .
She had a minimally invasive single vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1998 , consisting of a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> , she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .
She had cardiac catheretization at that time , which revealed patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , a dominant left circumflex artery , with an 80% stenosis and a patent right coronary artery .
She underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement to the left circumflex artery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/30</PHI>/02 she presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .
She was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .
Echocardiogram at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> for Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , plus / minus brachy therapy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 79 year old female , with acute distress .
BLOOD PRESSURE 110/60 , heart rate 60 , irregular .
O2 hemostasis of 97% , neurological awake , alert and oriented x three but poor short term memory and mild confusion .
HEENT - PERRLA , EOMI .
Neck was soft and supple .
JVP flat .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with mildly diminished breath sounds at the bases .
S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , with positive bowel sounds .
No bruits audible .
Lower extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
2+ bilateral femoral pulses without bruits .
LAB DATA RADIOLOGY :
Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cl 97 , CO2 26.7 .
BUN 29 , creat 1.7 .
Digoxin 1.0 , WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .
PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This patent was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Memasound Honvanta Hospital</PHI> .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/8</PHI>/02 she underwent a Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in stent restenosis with a 3.0 x 10.0 cutting balloon and then underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left circumflex lesion , followed by deployment of the 2.0 x 13.0 mm Pixel stent .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
After sheath removal , she was started on Fragmin in anticipation of maintaining anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .
She felt right leg weakness during the procedure , but experienced a great deal of difficulty the following morning , ambulating to the bathroom due to this weakness , which resolved after 2-3 hours .
She was seen in consultation by Neurology .
She underwent head CT which showed old lacunes and bilateral basal ganglia and ? of small hypodensity in the left frontal lobe .
MRI was recommended , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/12</PHI> she underwent an MRI which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the P2 segment of the right PCA .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
Throughout the hospitalization she remained fatigued and lethargic , resisting mobilization .
She had no further neurologic symptoms .
Post cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .
She was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .
Eventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .
In order to evaluate this , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/21</PHI> she underwent renal MRA which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
She underwent abdominal CT which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .
She however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .
She was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
She is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Basically on admission , it was somewhat unclear what was the etiology of both her hyponatremia as well as her high creatinine .
The patient , of course , was seen by Renal and a renal biopsy was discussed .
Renal biopsy was done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/27</PHI>/96 and was uncomplicated .
The results showed focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents and was ? _ ? immune .
Patient was given cyclophosphamide 980 mg intravenously times one , Solu-Medrol one gram intravenously q.d. times three days , and she was started on Amphojel , nephrocaps , and calcium carbonate .
She was kept on a fluid restriction of 1000 cc per day for her poor urine output .
Patient was also put on a renal diet .
Patient had symptoms of epigastric pain , nausea , and vomiting probably secondary to her medications .
Slowly , however , that resolved and also , she had some encouraging signs of diuresis with decrease in creatinine and some improvement of her symptoms .
She continued to do quite well with her creatinine lowering finally to 2.8 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/04</PHI>/97 .
The patient was therefore discharged feeling relatively well with her decreased creatinine .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Na Fongbain</PHI> and she will also have a <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">HMC</PHI> two times a day to help her with insulin which she had necessitated since she had been started on Prednisone 60 mg q.d.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
INTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY AT 23 WEEKS .
HYPERCALCEMIA .
INFERIOR VENA CAVA OBSTRUCTION .
IMPENDING SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION .
IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/23</PHI> , she was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Stonge</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/5</PHI> , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nimaconwood Valley Hospital</PHI> for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/13</PHI>/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .

IVC obstruction :
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Hypoxia and shortness of breath :
Although the patient &apos;s room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
It was felt that the patient &apos;s extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/17</PHI>/91 .
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> as an out-patient .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI>/91 , he was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/08</PHI>/91 , the patient called Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
2) Recent PCP .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
5) PPD anergic .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
NECK :
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
GENITOURINARY :
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
( On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI> , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12</PHI>/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/13</PHI>/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/16</PHI>/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/15</PHI>/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/18</PHI>/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .

SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lemgarson Hospital</PHI> service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 26</PHI> when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the <PHI TYPE="DATE">2th</PHI> the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</PHI> .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Joasscchird</PHI> , tel. <PHI TYPE="PHONE">090-249-6079</PHI> , at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Do Of Hospital</PHI> , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">AH</PHI> and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> in one week and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Work</PHI> the gastrointestinal fellow here at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73-year-old white man status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 admitted for catheterization for evaluation of the current anginal symptoms and a positive exercise tolerance test .
The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 because of unstable angina with LIMA to the LAD and SVG to the OMB and PDA .
The patient was free of angina until six weeks prior to admission when he began to have anginal symptoms described as a heaviness beginning in the scapula , moving to the retrosternal chest and radiating to the left shoulder with no other associated symptoms .
These anginal episodes occurred after exercise and also at rest resolving in two to five minutes .
An exercise tolerance test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/92 was stopped at seven minutes because of fatigue and chest pain .
There were positive EKG changes in the inferolateral leads and thallium showed a reversible ischemia in the inferoapical region .
Addition of diltiazem to the patient &apos;s aspirin and Dyazide medical treatment had no improvement in symptoms .
The patient had no symptoms of congestive heart failure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia .
The patient started Leukorin treatment two days prior to admission for a white count of 100,000 .
Hypertension .
Hyperlipidemia .
Left total hip replacement in 1988 .
Low back pain .
Right internal carotid artery stenosis of 80-90% diagnosed by carotid noninvasives after an episode of amaurosis fugax .
Gout .
Skin cancer .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day ; Levoxine , 0.1 mg q day ; Leukorin , 2 mg two po q a.m.
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative except for increasing fatigue in the past two weeks and leg cramps at night .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a blood pressure of 158/88 .
Pulse 70 .
Temperature 97.4 .
Respiratory rate 18 .
Physical examination was significant for ulcerated fungating lesions on his left ear , dorsum of his hands .
There was a right carotid bruit .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , S4 without murmurs .
Spleen was felt 4 cm below the costal margin .
The liver was 10 cm by percussion .
There were palpable inguinal lymph nodes .
Pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a white blood cell count of 77.8 with 82% lymphs .
Hematocrit 35.2 .
Platelet count 104,000 .
BUN / creatinine 26/1.4 .
Potassium 4.4 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , normal axis and intervals , no changes from previous EKG , no signs of ischemia or infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/2</PHI>/92 which showed the following :
Pressures RA 9/4 , RV 24/7 , PA 24/12 with a mean of 14 , PCW 12/9 with a mean of 10 .
Cardiac output 6.7 .
Cardiac index 3.2 .
SVR 943 .
Angiography showed an occluded SVG graft to OM1 , patent SVG graft to the RCA , patent LIMA to the LAD .
There was also 50% occlusion of the left proximal circumflex , 95% occlusion of the right proximal coronary artery , 50% occlusion of the OMB1 , 90% occlusion of the mid LAD .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient then underwent PTCA of the distal RCA lesion .
Because of difficulty passing the wire through the graft to the RCA , the proximal 95% RCA lesion was dilated first and then the distal RCA lesion was dilated .
The patient received 600 cc of contrast and the PTCA procedure took approximately three hours .
The patient did not experience any chest pain during the procedure and has not had any chest pain since the procedure .
The sheaths were removed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4</PHI>/92 and heparin was restarted four hours after sheath removal and maintained for two days because of a possible small dissection in the RCA .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 25 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4</PHI>/92 .
Repeat hematocrit showed it to be stable at 27 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/5</PHI> .
It was thought that the drop in hematocrit was secondary to his chemotherapy , some small dilutional effect and small blood loss from the PTCA , although there was no evidence of significant bleeding .
The patient was asymptomatic except for some back pain from lying flat after the catheterization procedures .
His vital signs remained stable .
He is to be discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/6</PHI> with follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kote</PHI> , his cardiologist and with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Right</PHI> , his hematologist .

FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cervical carcinoma ; bilateral ureteral obstruction secondary to the cancer .
Uremia .
Ileus .
OPERATION :
Bilateral ureteral stent placement .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 78-year-old woman had stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix and she has known periaortic and splenic metastases .
She was discharged from the hospital about 18 days prior to her admission , following a month long stay .
When her cancer was diagnosed , she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
She had extensive disease of the uterus , ovarian tubes , omentum and the periaortic lymph nodes .
Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .
She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .
The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jescdrig</PHI> was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center</PHI> .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
MICU COURSE-The patient was continued on Bactrim at 15 mg / kg per day in divided doses for his PCP pneumonia .
The patient was switched from p.o. Prednisone to IV Solu-Medrol at equivalent therapeutic doses .
The patient &apos;s respiratory wheezes were treated symptomatically with bronchodilators .
The patient &apos;s anemia was treated with folate , iron , and vitamin B-12 .
The patient was noted to be agitated at times with acute oxygen desaturations at these times .
The patient was started on a Morphine drip for control .
The patient &apos;s peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be elevated , consistent with an ARDS picture .
The patient was therefore started on pressure controlled ventilation resulting in a decrease in his PIP from 60 to 45 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10</PHI>/91 , the patient was noted to have an acutely diminished white count at 2.0 with a hematocrit of 32.0 .
The patient was also noted to have decreased urine output with an acute increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.2 .
Despite improvement in his chest x-ray noted on that day which was believed to be attributable to the steroids , the patient was switched to IV Pentamidine given the possibility of myelosuppression by Bactrim .
Consultation with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Test</PHI> led to a plan to begin aerosolized Pentamidine 100 mg nebilized q.d. for three days while therapeutic levels of Pentamidine could be build up in the lungs via IV .
However , the patient was noted to become increasingly hypotensive with decreased urine output .
The patient became anuric with increasing metabolic acidosis .
The patient was started on Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 hours for presumed sepsis .
Despite this measure , the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring the addition of Dopamine and Levophed drips .
The patient &apos;s condition deteriorated overnight with increasing metabolic acidosis despite bicarbonate .
The patient &apos;s oliguria renal failure continued despite fluid boluses and diuretics .
The patient &apos;s electrolytes became increasingly difficult to manage with hyperkalemia , hyperphosphatemia , and hypocalcemia .
On the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/11</PHI>/91 , the patient &apos;s blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable despite the addition of Neo-Synephrine .
At this time , his arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.07 , and the patient became aystolic .
The patient was subsequently declared dead at 7:58 A.M.
Medications at the time of death :
Pentamidine 100 mg nebulized q.d. times three days , Pentamidine 300 mg IV q.d. , Solu-Medrol 20 mg IV t.i.d. , Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 , Morphine sulfate drip at 5 mg / hour IV , Dopamine drip 18 mcg / kg/min IV drip , Pavulon 2 mg IV q1hour , Levophef 16 mcg / min IV drip , ferrous sulfate 324 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg per NG tube q.d. , vitamin B-12 , Colace , vitamin K , senna .

She was staged as lB and pathology showed a small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix .
She underwent a radical hysterectomy .
There were positive margins and positive nodes .
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .
Cystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative .
A CT , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis .
A biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated metastatic small cell neuroendocrine tumor .
Between <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating Cisplatin and VP-l6 with Vincristine , Cytoxan , and Adriamycin .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% .
Her chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of Cytoxan .
Also in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , she had right hip pain .
There was a bony metastasis .
Orthopedic Surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 30</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 4</PHI> of l99l , she received her first cycle of Ifosfamide and Mesna .
She had prolonged neutropenia and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 28</PHI> , she was admitted with a headache .
CT scan at that time was normal .
She had non-focal findings per the Neurology Service .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 6</PHI> , she began the next cycle of second line chemotherapy consisting of Carboplatin , Ifosfamide , and Mesna .
Since the last cycle of chemotherapy , she has had continued right hip pain and right mid lateral abdominal discomfort .
She also had complaint of a left perineal rash over the last two weeks .
She was started on Zovirax on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 3</PHI> .
She presents for a bone scan , blood transfusion , and consideration of her third cycle of second line chemotherapy .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Radical hysterectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of l989 , open reduction and internal fixation of femur in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , and examination under anesthesia , cystoscopy , and proctoscopy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of l990 .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
Spontaneous vaginal delivery times three .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Zovirax 200 mg five times daily , Methadone 50 mg t.i.d. , and Ativan p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure was ll0/70 , heart rate 84 , and temperature 97.4 .
HEENT :
No thyromegaly .
CHEST :
Clear to auscultation .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm .
there was no distinct costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Slightly distended .
There was mild tenderness to palpation in the right mid lateral abdomen .
There were no peritoneal signs and no guarding .
There were normal bowel sounds .
EXTREMITIES :
Without edema .
PELVIC :
By Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> revealed regrowth of the pelvic tumor .
There was a dry scaly rash with multiple small scabs on the left perineum and posterior thigh .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Her electrolytes were within normal limits , her BUN was ll , and creatinine was 0.8 .
Her ALT was l0 , total bilirubin 0.4 , and magnesium was l.8 .
Her admission CBC revealed a white blood count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands .
Her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for bone scan and blood transfusion as well as consideration of further chemotherapy .
The bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
Planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .
She was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .
She was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .
The patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .
Due to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> &apos;s concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Im Villtro University Medical Center</PHI> Medical Oncology Service was consulted .
They noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas .
However , they felt that at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Venbonlea Health</PHI> , there were several possible options including a possible phase I trial regimen .
The plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Im Villtro University Medical Center</PHI> next week .
On the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26</PHI>/06 , the patient was discharged home in stable condition .

Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotekoorsner</PHI> is a 57 year old white woman with mitral stenosis , atrial fibrillation , and cardiac risk factors including a positive family history , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia who presented for catheterization because of progressive worsening of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was told that she had a heart murmur approximately twenty years ago .
However , she had been asymptomatic at that time .
She now gives a history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and fatigue which has become more incapacitating over the past several months .
She states that previously , she had been fairly active but now does not feel that she can do much of anything .
She denies chest pain but complains of episodes of light headedness accompanied by diaphoresis which occur at rest approximately once per week and last for several minutes .
She also complains of a tight feeling in her abdomen .
She also has had a cough for the past several years which is worse in the wintertime and is non-productive .
She denies hemoptysis , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She complains of ankle swelling for the past several months .
Her course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation first diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">New Years Eve</PHI> of l989 and she has been on Digoxin and Coumadin .
Because of her worsening symptoms , the patient had an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Chogejuan St.ver , New Hampshire</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of l989 which showed mitral stenosis .
She is now referred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for evaluation of her mitral valvular disease .
The patient &apos;s cardiac risk factors include a positive family history in that both parents died in their fifties of heart disease and two brothers had coronary artery bypass graft procedures in their thirties , hypercholesterolemia for several years , and hypertension .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
There is no history of rheumatic heart disease recalled by the patient , removal of benign lump in the left breast .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. ( this was discontinued one week prior to admission ) , Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , Propranolol 20 mg q.d. , and Penicillin for dental procedures .
ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with her husband in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Glendmin</PHI> .
She has four children , ages 22 through 27 , and works as a cook at a grammer school .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotekoorsner</PHI> is a very pleasant woman who appears her stated age and is in no acute distress .
Vital signs showed that she had a blood pressure on the right which was l80/ll0 and a blood pressure on the left arm which was l84/ll0 , her pulse was 90 and was irregularly irregular , and her respirations were l6 per minute and were unlabored .
HEENT :
Unremarkable .
LUNGS :
Clear to auscultation and percussion .
CARDIAC :
Carotid arteries showed normal upstroke and volume without bruits bilaterally .
There was jugular venous distention to l7 cm at 45 degrees .
The point of maximal impulse was at the fifth intercostal space in the mid clavicular line .
There was a left parasternal lift .
There was a loud Sl and a physiologically split S2 with a prominent P2 component .
There was an opening snap immediately following the P2 .
There was a diastolic rumble at the apex which radiates to the axilla which is graded as a I / VI .
There was also a I / VI apical systolic murmur .
The patient &apos;s peripheral pulses were full .
There was no evidence of edema in the extremities .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , and there was a slight right upper quadrant fullness .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
However , there was evidence of subtle mental status change on the evening after the patient &apos;s valvuloplasty .
She was having difficulty remembering certain events which had occurred that day .
It was felt that because her neurological examination was non-focal at this time and that these changes represented no real change in her mental status from the time of admission , that no further work-up was required .
DISPOSITION :

SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in 1991 with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction .
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/17</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI> , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of March</PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/14</PHI>/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
He was hydrated vigorously .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/15</PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 .
The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI>/00 .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/20</PHI>/1991
HISTORY :
The patient is a seventy-two-year-old male with a history of diffuse atherosclerotic disease who had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 followed a failed angioplasty .
Coincident with the angioplasty he received a large contrast load leading to the development of renal failure and hemodialysis .
He also has had bilateral carotid endarterectomy and right aorto-femoral bypass .
The patient had done well until about two weeks prior to admission when he started developing several episodes of chest pain with minimal exertion .
He was admitted when he failed medical therapies for a diagnostic catheterization to evaluate his saphenous grafts and his native coronary circulation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical exam he had a blood pressure of 152/92 , pulse 80 and regular , respirations 18 .
On cardiac exam he had a slightly diffuse point of maximal impulse , normal S1 , split S2 , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the left sternal border , positive S4 .
The carotids were one plus with bruits bilaterally .
The left femoral is barely perceptible , right femoral two plus with a bruit .
The abdominal aorta was approximately 4 cm .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis , left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 17</PHI> , 1991 , the patient had a catheterization that showed an occluded proximal right coronary artery with the PDA filling via left to right collaterals , an occluded left circumflex after the OMB2 , and a very proximal occlusion of the LAD .
With regard to his saphenous grafts , the saphenous vein graft to the LAD was patent , as were the grafts to LADD1 and to the marginal territory .
The patient had recurrent chest pain at rest in the hospital .
Antianginals were increased and including Procardia was increased to 90 q.d.
These changes in his medical regiment seemed to significantly improve his angina .
It was decided that he would be discharged on medical management .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
During the hospitalization the patient was dialyzed for his renal failure .
On admission his BUN and creatinine were 7.4 and 48 .
He received dialysis without complication .
The patient was anemic .
On presentation he had a hematocrit of 29.5 secondary to renal failure .
He was transfused during the hospitalization .
He was discharged in stable condition on the following medications :
Procardia XL , 90 mg p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor , 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; nitroglycerine 1/150 1 tab s.l. p.r.n. pain ; Nitrol patch , 10 mg q.a.m. ; iron sulfate , 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nephrocaps , 1 tab. p.o. q.d. ; Xanax , 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
He is to have a low cholesterol , low fat renal diet .
Activities as tolerated .
He is to be followed-up by his private doctor .

The patient with a history of afib .
Afib was stable .
Coumadin and aspirin are held again secondary to his concurrent GI bleed .
2. GI :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
Hematocrit was checked q.8h and the patient was transfused again , as noted above , a total of 4 units packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 30 .
The patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive .
3. Endocrine :
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
The patient &apos;s fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage .
The patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .
4. Heme :
Hematocrit is stable .
Has remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions .
Over the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission .
On discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .
5. ID :
The patient was initially started on Levo 250 mg q.d. for a UTI .
However , his urine cultures were positive for MRSA and the patient completed a seven day course of Vancomycin IV .
6. Pulmonary :
The patient with a history of MRSA left lower lobe pneumonia .
We have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .
7. Renal :
The patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 .
His baseline was 1.8-2.2 likely pre renal azotemia and subsequently his creatinine improved with hydration and the packed red blood cell transfusions , and his creatinine steadily decreased down to his baseline .
On discharge his creatinine is 1.8 .
CODE STATUS :
Code is DNR / DNI .
TO DO PLAN :
1. The patient is to follow up with PCP , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Toob Obestimeuph</PHI> in two weeks .
2. The patient is to follow up with the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> GI Service in four weeks .
3. The patient is deconditioned secondary to his week long hospital stay and long rehabilitation stay and will require aggressive physical therapy .
4. The patient should have q.o.d. hematocrit checks to ensure that his hematocrit is above 30 and if it is below 30 should be transfused secondary to his underlying known CAD .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

No old EKG was available for comparison .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .
Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .
Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .
Serum IgG was elevated at l,520 .
SPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .
The patient underwent <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital</PHI> multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .
She had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .
Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .
Glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , and the <PHI TYPE="DATE">Septemberth of 2006</PHI> to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/15</PHI>/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .
Her Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/19</PHI>/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> with a fever .
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
Of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson &apos;s disease .
His wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for admission .
He was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
He has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .
ALLERGIES :
He had no known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
There was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Head CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Factor</PHI> agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
The patient &apos;s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Arnsperni Health</PHI> services .
Bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .
He did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/10</PHI>/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .
Brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
He was hypotensive into the 80s .
An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
A portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .
He was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
Discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .
They were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 , where Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Koteleebdils</PHI> was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 .
The family and the attending physician were notified .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
She underwent a sigmoid resection on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI>/96 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
At the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
A chest x-ray was read as clear .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/5</PHI>/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aacent Slentjae</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linatpromehack Worth Hospital</PHI> for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI>/96 .
She subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">June 25th</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th</PHI> of 1996 , which she tolerated well .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> .
She had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .
An MRI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/25</PHI>/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
However , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .
She presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(6) History of herpes zoster .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .
A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .
An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
She continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .
However , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/18</PHI>/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .
Make sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .
In addition to the above , she has the following additives :
20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 mEq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 mEq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 mEq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin K every Monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of Regular insulin .
Therefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Chelkjescchalsere</PHI> , who can be reached at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">148-701-5440</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
end stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. diverticulitis ,
2. perforated cecum ,
3. acute renal insufficiency .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic fossa and native left nephrectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-29</PHI>-94 .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
1. colonoscopy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-5</PHI>-94 ,

3. subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch and ileostomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-10</PHI>-94 ,
4. renal biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-13</PHI>-94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 59 year old male with end stage renal disease from hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
He started on dialysis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/92 and has been maintained on it since .
He is currently on eight times per week hemodialysis .
The patient is admitted for renal transplantation .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. hypertension ,
2. difficulty hearing ,
3. gout ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Nephrocaps , 1 q.day , Colace 1 q.day , Allopurinol 100 q.day , Verapamil 240 mg q.day , Niferex 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Colchicine 0.6 mg PO q.day , Phoslo 667 mg q.day , Cardura 1 mg PO q.day .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI>-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <PHI TYPE="ID">EXWAGH9T</PHI> protocol .
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone 20 mg PO q.day , Imuran 25 mg PO q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength PO qhs , Maalox 15 cc PO b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg PO b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg PO b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg PO b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg PO q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg PO t.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 4</PHI> , 1995 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Reg Cranka</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Win Shufffyfe</PHI> .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
He is a paraplegic from T4 down .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
He had a cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 1</PHI> , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 11</PHI> , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 6</PHI> , 1995 .
A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 25</PHI> , 1995 .
This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract .
There is no fistula seen .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Asha Vengloan</PHI> of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
The patient takes poorly his po. diet .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines .
4. GU :
The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
5. Skin :
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ca Shuff</PHI> who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
6. Infectious Disease :
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His other antibiotics were discontinued .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia .
7. Pain .
The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted .
He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone .
A complete summary of the patient &apos;s medications are as follows :
Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the Medicine team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990 , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
He was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% .
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Cirrhosis .
Atrial fibrillation since 1990 .
Recurrent urinary tract infections .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Tricuspid regurgitation .
Aortic stenosis .
Cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 .
Hyponatremia .
Peripheral vascular disease .

Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
Cipro 250 mg. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa medications .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His temperature was 99 .
Blood pressure was 104/66 .
Heart rate was 110 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
He had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position .
His heart rate was irregularly with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed stable for surgery .
After many discussions between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leickgrend</PHI> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He was taken to the Post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit , intubated and stable .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He was finally extubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/10</PHI>/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
His status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14</PHI>/95 , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/15</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Angio Suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI> , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
His white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia .
A Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
Throughout the day on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/95 , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .
At that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .
He had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
He was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Lump in anterior abdominal / groin area .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who has undergone a previous right axillary femoral bypass graft for left foot ischemia .
This was initially in 1993 , followed shortly thereafter by repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm with an aortobifemoral bypass graft .
The previous axillary femoral bypass graft was at that point ligated .
She reports approximately 48 hours prior to this developing pain in the right lower abdomen and groin and noticed a new onset of a lump .
She denies fever , chills or other abdominal pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history and past surgical history is significant for upper gastrointestinal bleed , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , history of hypertension , atrial fibrillation .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Prilosec , Lanoxin , Lescol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination reveals a thin woman in no acute distress .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination is unremarkable .
Chest clear to auscultation .
Abdomen :
soft with a palpable , nonpulsatile mass in the right lower abdomen which measures approximately 3 centimeters x 3 centimeters .
The previous axillary femoral bypass graft is readily apparent in the subcutaneous tissue along the right .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
An abdominal pelvic computerized tomography scan was obtained which showed no evidence of communication , pseudoaneurysm with a previous ongoing graft .
The patient does have a known large ascending aortic aneurysm and while she was admitted , this was studied with a chest computerized tomography scan .
The patient was brought to the operating room and under inhalation anesthetic , the old graft from the upper abdomen to the groin was removed .
The wounds were closed primarily .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
She will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ray</PHI> in approximately one week &apos;s time , as well as follow up with thoracic surgeon for consideration of repair of the ascending aortic aneurysm .

DEATH SUMMARY
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION FOR LYMPHOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 61-year-old white man with a history of mediastinal lymphoma who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
The patient was diagnosed with lymphoma in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 1988 when a biopsy of her left cervical node revealed T cell versus Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
He underwent intensive chemotherapy and entered a complete remission .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/89 , he developed B symptoms and work-up revealed relapse in the mediastinum , retroperitoneum , and bone marrow .
He underwent salvage chemotherapy and again went into remission .
He was then admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/20</PHI>/90 for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for hypertension .
Right mastectomy for benign lesion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed the patient to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 80 .
Respirations were 16 .
His physical examination was noteable only for the following .
His lungs were clear .
Cardiac exam was normal .
Abdomen was benign .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a normal SMA-7 except for potassium of 3.1 .
His liver function tests showed a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 139 but was otherwise normal .
Hematocrit was 29.3 .
White blood cell count was 4.5 .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent conditioning with Cytoxan , VP-16 , and VCNU .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
1. Fever and neutropenia :
The patient developed fever and neutropenia without any clear source .
He was treated with multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime , gentamicin , vancomycin and ampho .
Despite this , the fevers persisted until he no longer was neutropenic .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Multiple abdominal ultrasound revealed no biliary dilatation ; there was evidence of gallbladder polyps versus stones on one ultrasound .
Despite aggressive supportive care , the patient &apos;s liver pathology did not resolve and he continued to have progressive hepatic failure .
Towards the end of the hospitalization , his bilirubins were in the high 30&apos;s and low 40&apos;s .
3. Renal failure :
Despite aggressive attempts to maintain his intravascular volume , the patient &apos;s renal function progressively declined .
He received multiple transfusions with coloids , including red blood cells and albumin .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
4. Respiratory :
Because of mechanical limitations imposed by his ascites , the patient had severe tachypnea and required supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygenation .
Despite a very aggressive approach to his care , the patient continued to decline .
Therefore , in close discussion with the family , he was made DNR .
The patient &apos;s clinical situation continued to deteriorate and he died on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/9</PHI>/90 at 4:30 a.m.
An autopsy was refused .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. STAGE IV ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
2. STAGE III-C OVARIAN CANCER
TREATMENTS :
Chemotherapy of IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida 0 with stage IV endometrial cancer and stage III-C ovarian cancer vs metastatic endometrial cancer for line 2 , cycle 1 chemotherapy .
The patient presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 , with heavy bleeding per vagina .
D and C showed grade II-III adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Com St. , Tton , Arkansas 32167</PHI> .
The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 .
At that time , tumor was found to be studding on the right diaphragm , gross tumor in the omentum and large bowel , tumor through the uterine serosa .
Pathology showed grade II-III papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with squamous differentiation which was focally invasive and superficial myometrium .
The ovary showed papillary serous adeno with omental involvement consistent with an endometroid adenocarcinoma .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
The patient underwent 6 cycles of CAP in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Pemrancetul Tonsst.</PHI> .
However , during the fourth cycle , Cytoxan was dropped .
Her CA-125 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6-27</PHI>-91 , was 249 and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-29</PHI>-91 , was 734 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>-92 , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center</PHI> with left leg DVT and started on Heparin therapy .
She was discharged from there on Coumadin therapy .
On admission , the patient has no complaints except anxiety .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 5 mg po q d , Tagamet 400 mg po q d , Amoxicillin which was started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</PHI> , for a sore throat and Ativan 1 mg po prn nausea / anxiety .
ALLERGIES :
The patient gets hives to aspirin and tomatoes also cause her hives .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The temp was 99.4 , BP 114/78 , pulse 128 and respirations 20 .
She was an anxious female , in no acute distress .
HEENT exam showed PERRLA , EOMI , oropharynx benign .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
CV was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , positive bowel sounds , non tender , large , hard mass occupying the lower abdomen and left upper quadrant .
The extremities were non tender without edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the sodium was 136 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 98 , CO2 20 , BUN 8 , creatinine 0.8 and glucose 94 , ALT 5 , AST 10 , LDH 166 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , total bili 0.6 , direct bili .3 , albumin 3.3 , calcium 8.8 and uric acid 3.1 .
She had CA-125 which was pending at the time of discharge .
Her hematocrit was 31.1 , WBC 11.6 and 151,000 platelets .
PLAN :
The patient is thus stage IV endometrial and stage III-C ovarian vs metastatic endometrial for line II , cycle I chemotherapy IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
The plan was for urinalysis q d.
With the history of DVT , we plan Coumadin and check her coags .
The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block .
When compared with ECG of <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-06</PHI>-90 , there was borderline criteria for anterior MI although the patient denied any chest pain at any point .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient &apos;s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC&apos;s .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC&apos;s in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC&apos;s in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient &apos;s hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-10</PHI> .
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s at that time .
However , the patient &apos;s hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-11</PHI> , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
Her repeat on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI> , was 36.0/68.2 and her Coumadin was held .
She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge , her PT was down to 16.2 .
She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit on the day of discharge was 35.6 showing significant bump in her count after her second two units of packed RBC&apos;s .
Her PT on the day of discharge was 13.2 and she was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d as mentioned .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-12</PHI>-92 , with the approval of her attending physiciana , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Porriede Friednantflirt</PHI> .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-28</PHI>-92 , the patient will return for chemotherapy and she will follow up with her primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jescspald</PHI> , for repeat PT and Coumadin dosing on Monday , <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-14</PHI>-02 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Laymie Fournier</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leebjescobe</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia</PHI> who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center</PHI> .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 140/100 , phosphorus 94 , weight 181 lb .
Head , neck :
unremarkable .
Lungs clear .
Carotids normal .
Cardiac :
Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological :
Nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .
Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .
MCV was 85 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Sligh</PHI> .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Leigh</PHI> and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/31</PHI> which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/02</PHI>/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Thorebreutz</PHI> took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ryna Jescdrig</PHI> .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/05</PHI> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
STATUS POST MULTIPLE EMBOLISMS AND LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBUS PROCEDURES :
LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBECTOMY .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh .
The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">04</PHI>-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual .
The patient presents now with a 3 month history of dizziness and mood changes .
He also complains of continued left arm paresthesias .
The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>-89 , which was uncomplicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness .
His search had previously been negative .
A recent echo showed 1+ MR , inferior apical and left ventricular akinesis and a 3 x 2.5 cm spherical mass in the inferior apical left ventricle .
This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-12</PHI>-92 .
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for the removal of this left ventricular mass .
Coronary angiography during the cardiac cath had revealed normal coronaries without coronary artery disease .
After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-14</PHI>-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus .
The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin .
His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness .
His neurologic work up , however , was negative .
A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative .
The patient suffered no further dizzy spells during the further postop days .
He was discharged in good condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-22</PHI>-92 .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Synthroid .1 mg po q d , Metamucil one pack po q d , Persantine 50 mg po t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , Anusol cream at anal t.i.d. , Coumadin for PTT equal 20 seconds as directed , Albuterol inhaler two puffs q 6 h prn .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
Since our Hematology consultant recommended to keep the patient &apos;s PT in the range of 20-22 seconds , the patient will require close follow up of his PT&apos;s while on Coumadin .
This was discussed with the patient &apos;s local medical doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Royneo Walla</PHI> .
The patient will receive further follow up including evoked potential studies by our Neurology Service .
He has an appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">O Kotea</PHI> for his cardiac surgical follow up 4 weeks post discharge .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Shuff</PHI> was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> because of the development of a sudden marked increase in her level of dyspnea .
She was known to have metastatic small cell lung carcinoma for which she had been treated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iand Bontbreun</PHI> with multiple courses of chemotherapy as well as localized radiation therapy .
She had recently had cerebral metastases , which was treated by aspiration and is also known to have bone metastases .
A few days prior to admission she developed severe dyspnea .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was markedly dyspneic , sitting upright and completely unable to lie flat .
She has small amounts of active hemoptysis , no evidence of superior mediastinal syndrome .
The heart rate was 110 per minute , chest showed diffuse rhonchi throughout .
Decreased breath sounds right upper lobe .
No murmur , rub or gallop or cardiomegaly was noted .
One finger hepatomegaly was present without splenomegaly and there was no peripheral edema .
The arterial blood gases on room air sitting upright PO2 67 mm. Mercury , PCO2 42 mm. Mercury , pH 7.47. hematocrit 41.4 , sodium 123 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 88 , BUN 12 , creatinine .6 mg. % , LDH 692 , units , alkaline phosphatase 234 units , her chest X-ray showed consolidation of the right upper lobe and a markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm .
A computerized tomography scan taken in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1995 showed marked atelectasis of the right middle lobe and right upper lobe , with marked intraolobular septal thickening , probably representing interstitial carcinoma , and a markedly dilated right hilum .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Oarekote</PHI> from the Department of chemotherapy , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Skizeis</PHI> from Radiation Therapy , both of whom conclude that they did not have any additional therapy , which would improve her condition .

DIAGNOSIS :
RECURRENT CLEAR CELL OVARIAN CARCINOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The history of present illness and PAST MEDICAL HISTORY are unavailable , because there was no History and Physical on the chart .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Synthroid .2 milligrams by mouth per day .
ALLERGIES are no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was not documented on the chart .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , hematocrit was 37 , baseline creatinine .9 .
postoperatively , her hematocrit fell to as low as 23.8 , for which she was transfused up to hematocrit of 33 and remained stable between 30 and 33 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to surgery on the day of admission , where she underwent exploratory laparotomy and a 5-centimeter tumor mass was identified , which was adherent and possibly intrinsic to the sigmoid colon , and also noted were firm and large periaortic lymph nodes bilaterally .
Because of these operative findings , only a biopsy was sent , which confirmed metastatic clear cell carcinoma , and further bowel surgery was not attempted .
Postoperatively , the patient &apos;s course was complicated initially by a falling hematocrit , which was transfused and then remained stable .
The she continued to have low-grade postoperative fevers until approximately 8 days postoperatively when her temperature spiked .
A pelvic ultrasound was obtained , which showed a large fluid collection in the pelvis .
This collection was tapped and found to be blood mixed with pus .
A drain was placed under ultrasound guidance and cultures were sent .
Cultures so far have grown suspected Pseudomonas from the liquid medium only , sensitivities are pending .
The patient was placed on ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl , and the fluid collection was drained over 4 days .
The drain was removed on postoperative day #12 .
The patient remained afebrile and antibiotics were stopped .
DISPOSITION :

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/04</PHI>/94 .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Hispit , Delaware</PHI> .
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Coronaries were completely normal .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/31</PHI>/94 when she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Souland</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nixmont Bovo</PHI> with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
Dring this hospitalization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hahkellrick Hospital</PHI> , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI>/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Alllo Eino Hospital</PHI> which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI>/94 an EPS study was performed .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 .
Note , from <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/10</PHI>/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
At this point it was felt the patient would go home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/94 .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Vonamemp , LA</PHI> via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. Primary central nervous system lymphoma .
2. Pancytopenia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old right hand dominant white female with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the right side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the right cerebral peduncle .
The patient underwent a biopsy which showed a primary CNS lymphoma .
The patient was initially treated with high-dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response .
However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed .
At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) .
On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy .
The patient remained stable to the last few days prior to admission when she developed insidious rectal bleeding , probably from her external hemorrhoids , along with decreasing platelet count .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
The patient complained of chronic constipation and rectal bleeding after each bowel movement .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/25</PHI>/95 :
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 26</PHI> , white blood count 2.5 , hematocrit 29 , platelet count 32,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 27</PHI> , white blood count 1.6 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 28,000 :
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
Sodium 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
The patient &apos;s white blood count improved with the GCSF and her counts went up to 18.2 on the day of discharge .
The patient &apos;s hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 2</PHI> .
The patient had a follow up MRI scan which showed no significant change of tumor mass .
However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
The patient was assimilated on the day of discharge and the patient will be started on radiation therapy in a few days .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 6 mg po tid ; and she should continue Inderal , Synthroid and Zoloft at the present dose and frequency .
The patient was instructed to call us with any clinical or neurological symptoms .
The patient will have a follow up complete blood count with differential on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>

He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with recurrent chest pain .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with a typical episode of this discomfort in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
That was his first <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> admission .
Because of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
His angiograms from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 13</PHI> , 1994 .
There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
Starting in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
His most recent admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> is on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 5</PHI> , of 1994 .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-9</PHI>-94 .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His heart rate was 88 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3.2 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10</PHI>-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lato Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13</PHI> .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> was brought back down to the pain clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 27</PHI> , 1995 .

7. Weight loss , presumably secondary to Cryptococcosis , and AIDS .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Very cachectic , malnourished young man , with extensive oral and facial Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma .
Temperature was 98.8 , blood pressure was 114/70 , heart rate was 72 , respirations were 18 .
Skin :
Scattered Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma , several necrotic lesions , right lower extremity , consistent with chronic ulcers .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :
Fundi were normal , eomi , pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
Prominent hard right upper cervical lymph node .
Chest was clear .
Cor :
No murmur .
Abdomen was soft and nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly , guaiac positive ( oral bleeding from Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma ) .
GU was normal .
Extremities :
No edema .
Neurologic :
Question left facial weakness , otherwise nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium was 130 , potassium was 2.0 , phosphorus was 1.8 , magnesium was 1.0 , SGOT was 41 , hematocrit was 34.6 , white blood count was 3.4 , platelet count was 134,000 , chest X-ray was clear .
Head CAT-scan :
No progression of toxoplasmosis , multiple abnormalities consistent with PML .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Malnutrition / cachexia/diarrhea / Cryptosporidiosis .
The patient was treated with PPN and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .
Paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .
AZT was initiated .
Stool was negative for Cryptosporidium .
His diarrhea diminished .
He developed urinary retention and abdominal pain , which resolved with discontinuation of Lomotil .
However , KUB showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .
As he improved symptomatically and was able to take po without discomfort , it was decided to follow him clinically .
On this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so Neutra-Phos K was continued at discharge .
Lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .
2. Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma :
Coincident with peripheral parenteral nutrition , the patient developed severe facial swelling , as well as an extreme increase in Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma lesions , with almost total engulfing of his teeth .
He was treated with Vincristine , followed several days later by Bleomycin , with return of his condition to somewhat better than baseline on admission .
It was planned to give him one more dose of Vincristine prior to discharge .
3. Pancytopenia :
There was a decrease in CBC , which was ascribed to AZT , which was discontinued .
He received one unit packed red blood cells .
4. Chronic VZV :
Biopsy of right lower extremity lesion showed VZV .
Acyclovir was initiated .
5. AIDS / disposition :
The patient &apos;s prognosis is very poor and was discussed with the patient and family .
Doses of medications were adjusted to his weight .
Arrangements were made for hospice care locally , with the hope that the patient could move to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Lacin , South Dakota</PHI> for continuing care by his sisters there .
The patient was discharged in improved condition , taking po , and able to take care of personal hygiene with assistance .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
SYNCOPE .
HYPERTENSION .
INDUCIBLE COMPLETE HEART BLOCK .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness .
There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms .
The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats for which she was treated with Flecainide .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
Her Flecainide was discontinued and she was referred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
History of upper GI bleeding in 1985 while on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
None known .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
Her husband is in a nursing home .
She is a nonsmoker , nondrinker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pleasant elderly lady in no apparent distress .
Blood pressure 140/70 , heart rate 84 , with occasional premature beats , respirations 16 , afebrile .
Skin :
Showed bruises over both her knees .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
Neck :
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Lungs :
Clear .
COR :
Showed no JVD .
Normal S1 and S2 without murmurs .
There was a soft right carotid and right femoral bruit .
Digital pulses were absent bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
Bowel sounds present .
CNS :
Alert and oriented .
Cranial nerves intact .
Sensory motor examination was grossly intact .
Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Extremities :
Showed nodes in both hands and crepitans of both knees .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit 44 , WBC count 4.9 thousand , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 thousand , potassium 3.6 , PT and PTT were within normal limits .
LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
EKG was within normal limits .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a catheterization revealed an 80% mid-RCA stenosis , 80% mid-LAD lesion and an LVEF of approximately 80% .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
DISPOSITION :
Calan SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Vaseretic 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ibuprofen and Cytotec prn joint pain .
The patient is discharged home .
Followup with primary physician in one week .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Nakoloyd Knutzxelljesc</PHI> is a fifty-one year old female who presented with metastatic lung cancer in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> 1994 .
A work up at that time included a chest X-ray which showed a right hilar mass .
A chest computerized tomography scan showed a right hilar mass , extensive mediastinal adenopathy .
A bone scan showed lesions at T12 and T9 .
Abdominal CT scan showed normal adrenal .
Magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine revealed an erosive lesion at T12 and no cord compression .
A biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma .
The patient was entered onto the ICE-T protocol and received three cycles of ICE-T.
After cycle two she had an MRI of the T-spine which showed some improvement in the disease .
After cycle three , she developed severe headache .
An MRI of the central nervous system was done and was unremarkable .
The pain her head became so severe she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">E Health</PHI> after cycle three with fever , neutropenia , headache , and a cellulitis on the left forearm possibly from an intravenous site .
She was discharged from the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-04</PHI>-94 with all of her problems under reasonable control except for her severe headache .
She called me on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 5</PHI> , which was one day later , with the headache becoming much worse and becoming disabling .
She , therefore , was admitted for evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination revealed a middle aged woman with alopecia , and in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 100/60 , pulse of 70 , respirations of 20 , temperature was 98.6 .
Skin with alopecia , as noted .
HEENT examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The lungs were clear .
Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm , without murmurs .
Breast exam with status post bilateral implants .
Belly was soft and nontender .
Extremities without edema .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
The white blood count was 9.8 , hematocrit was 29.1 , platelet count was 233,000 .
She had 58% polys , 21% bands , 7% lymphs , 7% monos .
The prothrombin time was 10.6 .
The BUN and creatinine was 13/0.7 , glucose 115 , amylase less than 30 , calcium 9.2 , phosphorus 4.9 , magnesium 1.7 , alkaline phosphatase 302 , SGOT 42 , LDH 360 , CPK 348 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Because of the severe headache , she was seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rashanemar Block</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riord R. Hall</PHI> .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rashanemar Block</PHI> did a lumbar puncture which revealed an opening pressure of 27 , and her cytologies came back positive for adenocarcinoma .
She was seen in consultation by the Pain Service who placed her on a posterior communicating artery pump which helped her dramatically .
In addition , we obtained both cranial and neck MR which showed no evidence of any enhancement or epidural abscess .
When it was found that she had carcinomatous meningitis , she began interthecal methotrexate , given to her every three to four days by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hall</PHI> .
This was well tolerated .
Her cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained greater than 35 cm of water for the first several days and because of this we decided to place an Ommaya reservoir .
The patient was seen in consultation by Radiation Therapy who did not feel that radiation at this point would offer any advantages .
She had a CSF flow study which showed normal flow CSF throughout her brain .
She had multiple episodes of seizures during the hospitalization and required therapy with Tegretol .
She was given some Mexiletine and Trazodone and did not tolerate that well .
Once she was on good anti-seizure medicine , she calmed down very nicely in terms of not having any additional seizures .
For the last several days of her hospitalization , we switched her over to a Duragesic patch and she actually took 300 micrograms per hour of Duragesic and that seemed to make a big difference in terms of her pain control .
Her headache came under very nice control with aggressive Duragesic patch .
Access became a major problem and we had Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Anruchelle Chaffchird</PHI> from Surgical Oncology place a double Port-a-cath without difficulty .
The plan with <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Knutzxelljesc</PHI> will be to follow her very carefully .
She will be coming back to see us next Tuesday for infusion of her methotrexate .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 67-year-old gravida 7 , para 7 white female with metastatic endometrial carcinoma who presented with increasing left lower extremity pain for pain management , anemia , diarrhea .
For her anemia , she received two units of packed red blood cells and tolerated this well .
Hematocrit was 29-30 after her two units of packed red blood cells .
For her increasing left lower extremity pain , she received a pain service consult .
Deep venous thrombosis was ruled out , negative lower extremity noninvasive tests .
The Pain Service started her on MSR Contin and Amitriptyline .
After a few days , she found great relief from her left hip pain .
She still , however , was unable to move it adequately with the aid of Physical Therapy .
She began having some hallucinations which she felt were real .
Psychiatry was consulted and they suggested stopping her Amitriptyline which was done and adding Haldol 1 mg at night and b.i.d. as needed .
Because she had increasing tremors and hallucinations .
Neurology felt that her hallucinations were also most likely due to pain medication and her tremors were enhanced physiological tremor and they suggested trying Mescaline at low doses .
It was felt that the MS Contin should be stopped and that she should be started on a PCA .
She was therefore started on a PCA with constant infusion of 0.3 mg / hour and a rescue dose of 0.1 mg every ten minutes times three doses / hour .
She was also started on Mescaline 60 mg p.o. q. day for her tremor .
Also , while in the hospital , the patient developed a Klebsiella pneumonia UTI for which she received seven days of Ancef because she continues to require an indwelling Foley , she was started on Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day as prophylaxis .
The patient &apos;s cultures from her stool returned positive for C-difficile toxin .
She was , therefore , started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-15</PHI>-91 on Vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
She will continue on this until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-25</PHI>-91 .
Her diarrhea has resolved on this medication .
The patient also underwent chemotherapy treatment during this hospital visit .
She first had a Hickman line placed for chemotherapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-17</PHI>-92 .
She tolerated this procedure well and the Hickman line has continued to function well .
She had a 24-hour urine which had a creatinine clearance of 57 and a normal RBG with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% .
Her chemotherapy was not started until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-19</PHI>-92 because the treatment had been started for her C-difficile .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7</PHI>-20 , her diarrhea had resolved and she was started on chemotherapy .
She received Adriamycin 54 mg times two and 200 mg / meter squared of Carbo .
She tolerated this chemotherapy well .
She will get biweekly laboratory results followed .
She also was found to have Candida UTI and was treated for two days with Ampicillin , bladder irritation and follow-up culture was negative .
DISPOSITION :
It was felt that the patient required care facility placement and she will be continued on PCA for her pain management .
Therefore , appropriate chronic care facilities were investigated .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Triacetate 750 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day ; Dulcolax one p.o. q. day ; Aquaphor Cream to buttocks p.r.n. ; Senokot one p.o. q. day ; Vancomycin 25 mg p.o. q. 6 hours until 1-20 ; Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day ; Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. h.s. ; PCA allotted 0.3 mg / hour , rescue dose 0.1 mg every ten minutes three times an hour ; Mysoline 50 mg p.o. q. h.s.

LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 139 , potassium of 3.2 , chloride of 96 , bicarb of 32.1 , BUN of 79 , creatinine of 3.4 , glucose of 129 , magnesium of 2.2 and albumin of 3.2 , bilirubins of .4/.9 , alkaline phosphatase of 126 , SGOT of 27 , hematocrit of 27.6 , white count of 4.7 , PT of 13.4 , PTT of 26.5 .
His EKG showed atrial fibrillation versus frequent PVC &apos;s and no acute ST-T wave changes indicative of ischemia .
His chest x-ray showed mild cephalization of vessels but no evidence of overwhelming congestive heart failure and no air space disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and the following issues were addressed :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted and placed on IV dobutamine and also IV Lasix for diuresis .
He was also placed on varying vasodilator regimens .
It was thought that his Hydralazine had caused a drug induced lupus .
Initially , he was changed to Cozaar .
His creatinine then began to increase at this time and the patient became hypotensive .
He was then started on amlodipine up to 10 mg. PO QD with more stable blood pressure .
A few days prior to discharge , he was also begun back on his prazosin and currently is at 2 mg. PO QD .
He was aggressively diuresed with a goal dry weight of 121 pounds .
At the time of discharge , he was down to 123 pounds .
This is approximately 10 pounds less than his admission weight .
His dobutamine was discontinued approximately 2 days prior to discharge .
He continued to have a good urine output to a regimen of PO diuresis including Bumex 4 mg. PO BID , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID and Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID .
2. Renal :
The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency .
With optimization of his cardiac output and volume status , his creatinine improved to his baseline of 2.0 .
He continues to have approximately 500-700 cc. of urine output every eight hours .
He is fluid restricted to 1 liter of free water .
He should also follow a strict diet including 2 gram salt restriction per day .
3. GU :
The patient has had a Foley in place for several months for urinary retention and BPH .
He has failed a trial of Hydrin after discontinuation of his Foley .
Urology felt that this time that the only other option would be a suprapubic tube which would not decrease the risk of infection .
In consultation with the patient , it was decided to leave the Foley in place and to place him on daily Cipro for UTI prophylaxis .
4. Hematologic :
The patient has mild baseline pancytopenia .
He occasionally has a transfusion .
He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells the day before discharge for a hematocrit of 25 .
His hematocrit at the time of discharge is 30 .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is now discharged stably with a weight of 123 pounds to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lupe Frankcinevirg Asma Ein Health Care</PHI> for further management .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Gentamicin ointment to the left eye QHS , Ativan .5 mg. PO TID , Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID , Colace 100 mg. PO TID , Ciprofloxacin 250 mg. PO QD , amlodipine 10 mg. PO QD , Mevacor 20 mg. PO QD , Nitro-patch .6 mg. per hour once a day , digoxin .125 mg. PO QD , iron sulfate 325 mg. PO TID , Cardura 2 mg. PO QHS , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID , and Bumex 4 mg. PO BID .

There was no significant change from his baseline EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-7</PHI>-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .

He was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> and the date .
He was mildly perseverative and inattentive .
Coordination :
his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .
He was unable to stand without extensive assistance .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .
Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .
On the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Finger</PHI> was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .
He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/05</PHI>/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .
Follow up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Tvi Fine</PHI> of Neurology , and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Doll Grendbly</PHI> of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">10/04</PHI>/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic breast cancer .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Dehydration , generalized anxiety disorder .
HISTORY AND REASONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This 75-year-old woman presented on week prior to admission with nausea .
An enlarged liver was noted and ultrasound and CT scan showed multiple probable metastatic lesions .
She presented on the day of admission with nausea and weakness and was admitted for observation and coordination of treatment .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a weak , elderly woman in a wheel chair who could not walk without assistance .
Blood pressure 140/90 , pulse 80 , no cervical , supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy .
On the breasts , multiple , erythematous , scaly plaques with underlying induration and inversion of the nipple on the right , left breast without masses .
Abdomen :
Liver span 12 cm firm with mild , right upper quadrant tenderness .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Included a hematocrit of 41 , a white of 10,500 , platelets of 298 , alkaline phosphatase of 162 , potassium of 3.3 and remaining liver function tests and electrolytes normal .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without abnormalities .
Chest x-ray was clear .
RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was begun on intravenous hydration shortly after admission because of very poor PO fluid intake .
Diagnostic work up included a fine needle aspiration of her right breast lesion which revealed ductal carcinoma , with estrogen and progesterone receptor status pending at the time of discharge .
She had a bone scan which showed multiple areas of increased uptake , particularly in L1 , L3 and L4 , as well as the left sixth posterior rib .
This corresponded to a site of pain reported by the patient .
Her abdominal CT scan showed multiple lesions in the liver with enlarged periportal lymph nodes , cholelithiasis , and a left adrenal mass thought to likely represent metastatic disease .
During her hospitalization , the main issues were pain control and nausea .
Her pain was ultimately helped most by a regimen of oxycodone and oxycontin , and nausea responded to p.r.n. Trilafon .
She was somewhat sedated on this regimen , and her standing Serax dose was reduced with substitution of Klonopin .
She was seen by Radiation Medicine for palliative XRT to the painful lesions in her LS spine , and radiation therapy was begun on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/2</PHI>/97 with the plan for approximately 10 daily treatments .
She required considerable encouragement to maintain PO intake , and required intravenous hydration to achieve adequate fluid intake during her hospitalization .
A Physical Therapy evaluation could not be completed because of her degree of pain and nausea .
She is being discharged to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linghs County Medical Center</PHI> , with plans for continuing her tamoxifen pending estrogen receptor status availability which should be available within the coming week .
She will also continue x-ray therapy treatment and being physical therapy as tolerated .

ASSESSMENT :
This is a 74 year old woman with a vague poorly defined history of coronary disease and EKGs and history consistent with previous myocardial infarction who now presents hypertension , tachycardia , nausea and chest tightness with EKG changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Hospital course by system :
1. CARDIAC :
The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol .
She was placed on Nitropaste .
She was given Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
She was up to 50 mg po bid for improved blood pressure and rate control .
Her creatinine phosphokinases were cycled and she did subsequently rule out for a myocardial infarction with CKs of 114 , 115 and 106 with isoenzymes less than .4 , She was taken off her rule out protocol and underwent an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/31</PHI>/96 which showed an EF of 35% .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and dilated left atrium .
A diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with regional variations .
There was focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the anterior and midseptum suggesting scar .
The estimated ejection fraction as mentioned was 35% .
The right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .
There was also noted upper septal hypertrophy without evidence of outflow obstruction .
Given these echocardiographic findings she was begun an ACE inhibitor , Captopril , initially at 6.25 mg po tid .
This was gradually advanced as her blood pressure would tolerate and her dose of transfer will be 25 mg po tid .
She also underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/1</PHI>/96 which showed nondiagnostic EKG response to stress however there was noted an area of hypoperfusion consistent with an anterior infarct and there was no active ischemia .
She will be continued on an aspirin a day 325 mg po qd as well as Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
Given her recent start on an ACE inhibitor she will need to have her electrolytes , BUN and creatinine followed q 1 week x 4 weeks to be certain that her creatinine and potassium not dropping secondary to the ACE inhibitor .
Given that she has had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure she has not been placed on diuretics .
However , she should be maintained on a low sodium diet and if she were to develop signs or symptoms of heart failure initiation of Lasix titrating to good urine output and adequate symptom control , could be necessary .
She will not be transferred on Lasix however given that she has clinically been without any evidence of congestive heart failure .2 .
NEUROLOGY :
From a neurologic stand point the patient was initially quite agitated and unfamiliar with her surroundings .
She was initially managed with prn Haldol as well as being maintained on her neurologic and psychiatric medicines including Depakote , Prozac , Klonopin and Trilafon .
She gradually became less agitated and more cooperative .
However , she does express frequent need for attention .
She appears to be somewhat depressed , also intermittently confused and calling out for the nurse .
In talking with her daughter and her sister it sounds as though these are baseline characteristics for this patient and she will continue on her current regimen .
3. HYPERTENSION :
From the hypertensive stand point she was initially maintained on Nifedipine as well as being started on the beta-block and ACE inhibitor as mentioned above .
The Nifedipine was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/1</PHI>/96 in order to allow for pushing ahead with her ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as tolerated .
Her blood pressure has been under control on these medications .4 .
ORTHOPEDICS :
She did have right knee pain and swelling .
She underwent right knee plain film x-ray which showed an insignificant right knee effusion , osteoarthritic changes and no evidence of fracture .
Her knee pain gradually improved and she was up and walking on the day prior to transfer .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
She will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nelson</PHI> who follows her at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Montden Hospital</PHI> .
She will be transferred on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/2</PHI>/96 in good condition .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7-28</PHI>-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatic metastases from colon cancer .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Colon cancer ,
2. disseminated intravascular coagulopathy .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-28</PHI>-94 , right trisegmentectomy ( hepatic resection ) .
ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES :
1. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94 , exploratory laparotomy for bleeding ,
2. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94 , exploratory right thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Duhenile</PHI> for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy .
The patient initially presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1992 with bloody diarrhea .
She subsequently underwent a right colectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1992 for a Duke &apos;s C-II moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure .
She subsequently recent adjuvant 5-FU and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1993 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</PHI> of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy .
Postoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1994 .
A computerized tomography scan obtained in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes .
After two additional cycles of 5-FU and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers .
The computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-28</PHI>-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection .
Prior to surgery , the patient was taken to Vascular Radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms .
These demonstrated
1. portal vein patent ,
2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries ,
3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .
The patient was subsequently brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .
The operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .
The left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .
The intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .
The patient received 21 liters of lactated Ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .
There were 5300 cc given via the Cellsaver .
The patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .
The decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .
The patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .
The operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .
The patient was returned again to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .
The patient required blood pressure support with pressors .
Due to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .
The patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .
The abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .
The patient continued to require transfusions .
The patient &apos;s oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest X-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .
The ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .
The urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with Lasix and Mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .
As the patient &apos;s hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .
The study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .
Despite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a Protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94 .
At this point , the mechanical ventilator was turned off .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient expired .

PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE .
OPERATIONS / PROCEDURES :
FEMOROPOPLITEAL BYPASS ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-28</PHI>-90 , BY DR. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">RISHAN THOREGORB</PHI> .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is well known to the Chief Service and was recently discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-13</PHI>-90 .
Her original admission was for an ischemic left foot .
History reveals a 72 year old woman with multiple medical problems including chronic atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , polyarticular gouty arthritis , who is confined to a wheelchair .
She has peripheral vascular disease and ischemic left foot , for which she was admitted and underwent angiography and angioplasty on her previous admission , which was from <PHI TYPE="DATE">6-6</PHI>-90 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-13</PHI>-90 .
She had angioplasty of her left external iliac and proximal distal superficial femoral artery .
She returns for a progressively ischemic left foot .
She was admitted to the Service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-25</PHI>-90 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include .0675 of digoxin a day , prednisone 15 milligrams per day , Capoten 6.25 milligrams a day , Pepcid 20milligrams a day , cardizem 90 milligrams each morning .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her examination is remarkable for a Cushingoid-appearing woman in no acute distress with multiple ecchymoses over her body .
She has obvious deformities of her joints from her arthritic condition .
She has brisk upstrokes in the carotids without any bruits .
Lungs are clear .
Heart has normal rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
She has a colostomy on the left side that is healthy .
Extremities are remarkable for deformities secondary to arthritis with a swan deformity of her fingers .
Her pulses are carotids II+ bilaterally , radial pulses II+ bilaterally , right leg has II+ femoral , I+ dorsalis pedis and I+ posterior tibialis .
On the left side , she has no pulses below her femoral pulses .
On her left foot , her first , third and fourth toes are black with gangrene and there is an area of hyperemia just proximal to that .
She also has a ulcer on the left heel .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , laboratory data were unremarkable and within normal limits , except for creatinine 1.6. Hematocrit on admission was 34.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and had preoperative evaluation .
She was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-27</PHI>-90 , and underwent a left femoral to below-the-knee popliteal in situ graft using the saphenous vein .
The patient underwent the procedure without any complications and returned to her room .
Her hospital course was unremarkable .
Of note is the fact that her left leg was quite edematous postoperatively , likely due to the fact that her lymphatic system was interrupted and she had likely a venous thrombosis which is old in the left deep veins .
Her wound weeped serosanguinous fluid and was treated with dressing changes .
By the time of her discharge , her wound was significantly drier and she went home with dry sterile dressing changes only toher groin area .
She went home with staples intact due to the fact that she has poor wound healing secondary to chronic steroid use .
The patient had a Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse her entire hospitalization and her foot was warm .
There always remained asmall area of erythema in her forefoot , however , this was markedly improved .
Her gangrene stayed dry the whole time and she wastreated with 5 days of triple antibiotics .
During the hospitalization , the patient did develop a small flare in herarthritis , for which her rheumatologist was consulted and they increased her steroids for approximately 3 days .
The patient did well .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged to home , to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Thoregorb</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE include digoxin .0625 a day , prednisone 50 milligrams a day , cardizem 30 milligrams 3 times a day , K-Dur 20 milligrams a day .
The patient has her own visiting nurse and she will see to any wound care .

In general , this is an obese male in mild respiratory distress .
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy .

LABORATORY DATA :
White blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , MCV 81 .
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , BUN 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , AST 49 , ALT33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .
Discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
Code status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .
This is an unfortunate case but Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .

Pleural fluid pH is 7.29 , glucose 91 , total protein3.1 , LDH 296 , 70 white blood cells , 50 red blood cells .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Colitis .
The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis .
The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer .
He now returns with fever , rising white count , diarrhea , and dehydration .
Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl for presumed sepsis , either with urine or bowel source .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin .
Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative .
Stool for C. difficile returned positive .
The diagnosis , therefore , was relapsed C. difficile colitis .
Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin .
He improved clinically with defervescence , decreased white blood cell count to 10,000 with resolution of left shift , and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam .
An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing , primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left , consistent with C. difficile colitis .
The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia , however , was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future .
The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated .
He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge .
2. Azotemia .
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 .
Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration .
With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12/1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient .
The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess .
3. Mental status .
The patient was alert and oriented throughout the admission ; however , by personality , he is somewhat cantankerous and demanding of the nurses .
He was written for Haldol 1 mg p.o.b.i.d. p.r.n. to help with this problem .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
Medications on transfer include multivitamin 1 tablet p.o. q.d. ; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Ventolin inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ; Vancomycin 125 mg p.o. q.i.d. times seven days ; calcium carbonate 1250 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Lotrimin cream to groin b.i.d. p.r.n. ; O2 at four liters per minute ; and Haldol 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old white female who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oneoremadi Ryviewmawpa Greecounbci</PHI> with severe coronary artery disease and presented for coronary artery bypass grafting .
The patient overall had been in her usual state of good health until three to four months prior when she developed progressively worsening chest pain exacerbated bystress .
In retrospect she has had several years of rare episodes of chest pain attributed to indigestion .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/14</PHI>/94 she underwent a Persantine-thallium test at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center</PHI> which showed anterolateralischemia and she also developed chest pain during her study .
She was admitted for cardiac catheterization which on transfer today showed severe left main disease with occluded right coronary artery and 95 percent stenosis of the circumflex with severe proximal left anterior descending .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">TGCHO</PHI> for surgical evaluation and was stable throughout except for some chest pain during her cardiac catheterization relieved with morphine and intravenous nitroglycerin .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is above above , as well as ( 2 ) non-insulin diabetes mellitus which she is controlled on oral hypoglycemics , and ( 3 ) hypertension .
ALLERGIES :
None .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Tenormin 25 mg b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg q.d. , Diabinase 250 mg b.i.d. , nitroglycerin paste to chest wall , enteric coated aspirin one tablet PO q.d. , heparin intravenously , Dyazide 1 tablet PO q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
No alcohol use and quit tobacco greater than 25 years ago with a 10-pack year smoking history .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The vital signs were stable .
She was a pleasant obese white female in no acute distress .
HEENT examination was within normal limits ; neck was without adenopathy , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion ; heart regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds .
Abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
without deformities or varicosities .
Vascular showed 2 plus pulses except for her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses which were one plus .
She had a left carotid bruit .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the patient &apos;s severe three vessel coronary artery disease a Cardiac Surgery consult was obtained for possible coronary artery bypass grafting .
She was kept on intravenous heparin , nitroglycerin and beta blockade .
Regarding her carotid bruit a carotid non-invasive study was obtained which showed severe right internal carotid artery stenosis and moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis .
In conjunction with the cardiac surgeons Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ausguall</PHI> from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted for carotid endarterectomy on the right .
In anticipation of her endarterectomy she underwent an MRA angiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/22</PHI>/94 .
Results of the angiogram showed that she right internal carotid artery stenosis with some hemodynamic effect in the distal LCA lumen diameter .
Due to this result an urgent carotid endarterectomy along with her coronary artery bypass graft was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/25</PHI>/94 .
There were no complications and postoperatively she was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
She remained neurologically intact and did well from the Vascular Surgery stand point .
Her Intensive Care Unit stay was only notable for an increase in chest tube output which subsequently decreased and was removed prior to her transfer to the floor .
She had some ectopy , specifically frequent ectopic activity after her surgery for which a Cardiac Arrhythmia Service consult was obtained and she was put on a Holter monitor and echocardiogram was obtained .
She remained hemodynamically stable and wires were kept intact beyond postoperative day four since she had some evidence of heart block .
Her beta blocker was held and she continued to be in sinus rhythm versus atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions .
Echocardiogram revealed her left ventricle to be within normal limits and otherwise her study was negative .
Holter monitor results were pending at the time of discharge .
Wires were subsequently discontinued and her digoxin and beta blocker were discontinued .
Otherwise her hospital course was uneventful .
She tolerated a regular diet , wounds remained clean , dry and intact and she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Villtionnca Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/2</PHI>/94 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .
He had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .
He presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 1994 and was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital</PHI> .
The coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .
An echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .
He had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .
After the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .
The patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 8</PHI> , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Xingwa Moineswest</PHI> where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .
The tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital</PHI> for further evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .
His blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .
The carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .
The jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .
Lung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs .
Cardiovascular exam :
normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit .
The patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .
Intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 11</PHI> , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .
During the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .
Pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .
After mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .
After radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .
However , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .
Since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .
The patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 17</PHI> , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .
Then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .
The defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was uneventful .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 19</PHI> , the patient was taken back to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed .
Under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .
This was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .
Three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .
For tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .
For tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .
For tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .
VVI pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .
The patient felt good on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 20</PHI> .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .
He will have his prothrombin time checked on Monday and will follow up with the Defibrillator Clinic .

ATTENDING :
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LENNI EENAHILDE BREUTZOLN</PHI> MD , PHD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
Perirectal abscess and myelodysplastic syndrome .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 67-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome subtype and refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation .
She was admitted for perirectal pain and fever .
HISTORY BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS :
History of MDS diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 2002 .
At that time was evidence of disease progression with 22% blast , which led to treatment with five azacitidine on compassionate use basis starting in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 2003 .
On admission , she was status post three cycles of chemotherapy .
Her course have been complicated by perirectal pain and thrombosed hemorrhoids .
After her third cycle of chemotherapy , the patient noted worsening of her rectal pain along with fever and chills .
CT done as an outpatient showed inflammation and hemorrhoids but no obvious abscess .
The patient continues with rectal pain and fevers and eventually went to an outside hospital <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center</PHI> where CT scan revealed a tiny area on the right consistent with hemorrhoids versus a tiny perirectal abscess as said initially , but the pain was secondary to hemorrhoids and anal fissure and local care was provided .
The patient &apos;s status worsened with continued elevated temperatures to 103 and increase in rectal pain .
The patient noted a yellowish drainage from the rectum .
The patient was then transferred on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/14</PHI>/03 to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Gaanvantsir</PHI> due to her high-risk status .
Review of the CT scan from an outside hospital likely perirectal abscess given the CT was limited by not having IV ororal contrast .
The patient reports on admission having yellowish drainage from rectum occasionally pink , but no frank blood .
The stools were soft but formed .
Although , initially she has had constipation after starting chemotherapy .
She noted also nausea , decreased appetite , and decreased p.o. intake .
Also of note , on admission , she had increased urinary frequency but no difficulty urinating .
No weakness .
No abdominal pain .
Her temperature was elevated to 103 , but her blood pressure had been stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. From an infectious disease standpoint , she has a perirectal abscess .
Ceptaz and Flagyl were both started .
Blood cultures were done each morning for the first week with no growth during her hospitalization and her urinalysis and cultures were negative .
Surgery here saw the patient on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/03 and they did an incision and drainage of her perirectal abscess and recommended daily sitz bath and also recommended increasing her p.o. water and fiber intake over the following two days , although the patient developed a rectal fistula for which surgery again had to be called .
They placed the drain and continued to follow the patient .
The patient continued to spike temperatures with perirectal pain after surgery and the Nasalide was added to her antibiotic regimen to cover for enterococcus and MRSA given the patient &apos;s resistence to ampicillin B and her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus .
The patient spiked only once after beginning with Nasalide and had been afebrile for six days before discharge .
About three days of discharge , her PICC site became inflamed , but the patient remained stable and afebrile .
Her PICC line was pulled and the patient was switched off oral antibiotics .
She remained stable and afebrile for two days before being discharged and after starting her p.o. antibiotics .
From pain perspective , we used OxyContin and oxycodone , which was titrated up during her hospitalization to maximize pain control and for ease of bathroom use .
2. From diet perspective FEN , she was hyponatremic on admission , which was secondary to her dehydration and resolved with hydration .
Her nutritional status is poor on admission with low albumin and an elevated INR .
She was given vitamin K and Nutrition was consulted .
With supplements and multivitamins and encouragement , the patient improved and had increased liquid and solid intake prior to discharge .
3. Cardiovascular wise , the patient has history of hypertension , although blood pressure was not elevated during her hospitalization and hydrochlorothiazide she had on admission was discontinued .
4. Rheumatalogically , the patient has history of rheumatoid arthritis .
She was on 1 mg of prednisone every other day , which was tapered and discontinued .
This patient had no episodes of rheumatic pain .
5. From psychosocial plans perspective , the patient lives with her sister in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Pupeake Su Park</PHI> and was discharged to her sister &apos;s care with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">SMH</PHI> services for continued home care .
6. From Hematology / Oncology perspective , although the patient did not undergo any chemotherapy during this hospitalization .
Bone marrow biopsy was done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/17</PHI>/03 and the results were pending at the time of discharge .
The patient will follow up with her oncologist for her final results and for further treatment .
6. From genitourinary perspective , the patient complained of difficulty urinating .
She was started on Ditropan and that was suggested to optimize relief of symptoms .
On discharge , the patient had fewer complaints of difficulty starting her urine and upon discharge is to follow up with her PCP for further treatment .
The patient was advised at discharge to eat high fiber and plenty of fluids to do sitz baths five times daily .
She was scheduled for surgical follow up and was advised to call her PCP for fever , chills , worsening rectal pain , or increased rectal drainage .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Peridex mouth wash 12% 10 mL b.i.d. , clotrimazole one troche by mouth four times daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 0.5-1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea and anxiety , Flagyl 500 mg p.o.q.8h. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain , senna tablets two tablets by mouth twice daily , multivitamin with mineral one tablet p.o. everyday , Compazine 10 mg p.o. q.6h. , OxyContin 10 mgp .o. q.12h. , and Levaquin 500 mg p.o. everyday .
PROCEDURES :
Perirectal abscess incision and drainage done by surgery at the bedside , which was complicated by provision of a perirectal abscess and again the patient had to undergone under local anesthesia perirectal examination of her perirectal fistula with drain placement that was only her only complication .
CONDITION :
Her condition was stable upon discharge .
She will be discharged to her sister &apos;s home and with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">SMH</PHI> follow up for wound care .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/08</PHI>/2004
The patient has a known history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
He is admitted at this time because of significant GI bleeding .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Significant for fatigue and increased abdominal discomfort .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION :
Insulin , Celexa , Protonix , Ambien and Pancreas .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs showed his blood pressure to be slightly decreased at 120/60 , pulse 64 , respirations 16 , temperature 98.8 , O2 sat 95 .
HEENT :
Evidence of anemia with being pale , but anicteric , no oral lesions .
Neck supple .
Lungs clear .
Back without CVA or spinal tenderness .
Heart regular rate and rhythm .
Abdomen :
Bowel sounds positive , soft , mildly tender in the epigastrium without hepatosplenomegaly , mass or tenderness .
Extremities :
Trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing .
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 20.5 , after having been 32 one week earlier .
ASSESSMENT :
The assessment was that he had a GI bleed .
He was transfused and then evaluated by GI .
Endoscopy showed multiple angio ectasias throughout the stomach .
He received multiple treatments for this over the succeeding weeks .
In addition , he was transfused .
His platelet count was maintained with platelet transfusion as necessary .
He was treated with Octreotide to try to slow down the bleeding .
Despite all these measures , his bleeding was never totally controlled .
He then had an angiogram with Gel foam to try to control his GI bleed .
Again , this was unsuccessful .
At that point he had a change in mental status and was no longer responsive .
Given this , the decision was made to make his care comfort measures only .
At this point , he was made comfort measures and expired comfortably .
The cause of death was a combination of GI bleeding felt to be ultimately related to his known metastatic pancreatic cancer .
